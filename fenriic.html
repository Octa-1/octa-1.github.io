        When Fenriic was was younger, he had just become a soldier.  While marching through the woods, his regiment was ambushed by Orcs.  Fenriic survived but was left injured, and as he was about to be killed, a group of Elven arcane archers saved him.  He was then taken to their village to be healed.  The elders asked for his assistance in protecting the village from the Orcs, since almost all of their warriors we dead, and he said he would.  He only asked to be taught arcane archery in return.  They reluctantly agreed.  Over the next few days Fenriic was taught how to use a bow.  When the Orcs attacked, he helped the elves fight them off.  After he defeated the Orcs, the elves fulfilled their part of the deal and taught him their secrets.  That’s all I got so far.  He probably left to rejoin his regiment.  He was labeled a deserter, and ran away.  Low on money, he decided to take some small jobs just so he has something to live on.  Over time, his arcane archery became known far and wide, and many wealthy nobles and people of importance he wanted to hire him.  The more wealth he gained, the more wealth he wanted.  He eventually joined the mercenary group his with now.  One day, he decided to visit the elves.  He didn’t know why, maybe to thank them.  But when he got there, they shunned him.  They did not like how he used their sacred arts selfishly, to make money, and they forbid him from ever returning or using their arcane powers again.  Fenriic wouldn’t hear of it, and refused to give up his power.  They ran him out, shouting at him he’s not worthy of it and never will be.  He constantly denies it, but deep down, he knows it’s true, but is too proud to admit it.  But now, he sees Fate’s Fools as a way to redeem himself in the eyes of the elves and finally deserve the powers he has.
