       Sometimes... people change. Even if those people were who you thought you knew from your past. Every evening I think back to that day of reckoning and I often find myself asking why I never saw that before. I wish I could say that the mornings ale was to blame for my foolishness, or that my evenings restlessness was at fault. No. It wasnâ€™t that. It was my arrogance. In my newly established feeling of power and righteousness I could not see passed my own line of reality. It was my neglect that killed her! My optimism that had my city burned at the hands of the very person I thought I could trust! No. No more do I trust any single man with my judgement than I do a goblin not to steal even a copper piece. Now, my loyalty lies only to the destruction of the very arsonist I used to call friend. He will pay for what he has done in more than just his blood. I will make him watch as I make everything he cares about go up in flames. As a governor I used to believe that justice was the only fair form of prosecution, now all I seek is vengeance. I will have him in my grasp by whatever means. I do not care if he is beloved by others, for they will have been bloodshed as well. Only when his bloodline has deceased will I be cured of my lust for his eternal damnation. I will take his remains and rebuild Yltzberg on top of his remains. I will burry the very thing that made the city suffer beneath its very bricks. But that is all to come with time. I must venture out to find him first. I will need to stay mobile at all times to cover more area. The next time the traveling circus comes through here, expecting to find a city to entertain, I will slip right in, undetected. As they travel from city to city I will search for him until I locate him. He will be found one way or another, but only by my hands will he experience death.
