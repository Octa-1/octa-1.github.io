<p class="sessionrecap">
    The session started where the last one left off, as the party dragged their new friend Leosin, a monk who’s and expert on dragon cults, back towards Greenest. On the road he told them that in his time at the camp he discovered that there was a hidden cave that was holding a ton of dragon eggs that would be used as an army of dragons. Once they finally arrived they split up to complete two different tasks. Cormic and Ash brought Leosin to meet Nesim Waladra, who is a good friend to Leosin and was the one who sent the group to come find him. Brimless leaves to calm his nerves at the tavern. Orianna and Edison go to see the governor and tell him what they learned but they can’t get past his receptionist so they schedule a meeting for 3 tomorrow. Eventually, both groups start to hear civilians screaming from the tavern as they realize Brimless had gone into a blind rampage of fear when seeing the costumers dressed up in Mind Flayer costumes. Ori is the first one to get there and ends the conflict with a Calm Emotions spell. The party cheers up Brimless, apologizes to the commoners before going to sleep.
    The next day they head over to the local “eating shop” for breakfast. The owner tells them about a jar of pickles that they have that the store is famous for. No one has ever been able to open it. Every famous wizard or adventurer have tried their hand at it and failed. After trying for a while the party leaves and Ori and Edison go to meet the Governor. He tells them that they came back in one piece but the cult is a bigger threat then they thought and that they’re raising an army of dragons. The Governor rewards each party member with 250 gp. After getting their cash and resting up, the party set out to raid the camp. 
    The trek to the camp was eerily empty, and the camp was even more empty. It seemed like it had been abandoned. Once they entered the cave though, they found where everyone went as they were attacked by a group of Dragonclaw cultists.
    After dealing with them, the party found a split in the road with a door on one wall. Orianna entered the room on her own and came face to face with the one she wanted to fight most, Mondath. Mondath called in 11 guards that the rest of the party held off while Ori battled it out with her. The fight was tough but in the end Mondath knocked out Ori and Ash, who ran in to help. She was then finished off by Edison and Cormic who arrived after finally finishing off the guards. And that is where the sessions ended.

    The session starts up where we ended last time, with the party recovering from the battle with Mondath, many of them being severely damaged. After searching the room Mondath was in, the party found maps describing the Dragon Cults next plan of attack. Once everyone was healed, the party continued onward deeper into the dungeon, eventually coming across a trap door leading to a new area. After looking around for a bit they find a statue depicting Tiamat, the lord of dragons, with a chest sitting at the bottom. Attempting to open the chest triggered a trap, spraying acid gas from the walls that incapacitate Cormic and Edison, who were still damaged from the previous fight. Orianna, Brimless, and Ash carry their fallen allies to what they think is an escape as the gas follows them, but it ends up a dead end. A clutch investigation check from Orianna reveals another trap door, this time in the ceiling. After climbing through it, they barely have a moment to catch their breath before turning a corner to come face to face with Cyanwrath and three of his guards. Cyanwrath promises safety to everyone if he can finish his dual with Brimless uninterrupted. Brimless agrees with the terms that no weapons will be used. The fight begins, and Cyanwrath knocks Brimless to his feet with a lightning breath attack in an instant. Ori runs over to help an unconscious Brimless but is attacked by Cyanwrath for interrupting the fight, knocking her out, and triggering Cormic and Ash to go on the offensive. The fight begins, as Edison manages to wake up and each of the three are restrained by a guard while Cyanwrath forces them to watch him kill Brimless. But before he can, Brimless wakes back up and gets a good hit in while the Cormic, Ash, and Edison the guards. Eventually, Brimless is downed again and Ash manages to take the last hit on Cyanwrath, shooting a flaming crossbow bolt through his heart. After Cyanwrath is killed, the two remaining bodyguards reveal that they’re just mercenaries, doing any job to the highest bidder. They say that they have no alliance with the Dragon Cult and are willing team up with the party if they pay, which Cormic does. The party takes a rest and wakes up to continue their crawl into the dungeon to find the dragon eggs. Eventually as they walk one of the guards starts telling the party “hope you brought some fresh meat, otherwise Miguel’s not gonna be too happy”. They soon find out that Miguel is a particularly hungry ropper who happens to speak common. He politely demanded his fresh meat and after considering feeding him the bodyguards, they decide half of them will go retrieve Cyanwrath’s body while the others stay to make sure Miguel doesn’t get too mad. Ori, Brimless, and the bodyguards go to get the body while Cormic, Edison, and Ash stay behind. While Ori is gone, Cormic decides it would be a good idea to trick Miguel with a Minor Illusion spell. Unfortunately, that doesn’t go over too well for him and he looses his arm to Miguel who runs away right as Ori and Brimless get back, seeing Cormic bleeding out. And that’s we’re the session ended.

    <h2><bold>Mini-Session (Jarlaxle/Fenriic Origins)</bold></h2>
<p class="sessionrecap">
    We began by Jarlaxle being tasked by his Sensei to go to the nearby village Greenest in order to help deal with an Owlbear.  Fenriic, a mercenary, is given a job by his boss to go kill the same Owlbear.
    The two arrive at Greenest and are greeted by the mayor, who points them in the direction of the owlbear and informs them of their pay, 50gp.  While they are traveling, they encounter a group of 12 goblins led by Rolo, who know Fenriic from a past job and demand that he pay up.  Fenriic refuses, and after a loogie contest between Rolo and Jarlaxle, Fenriic shoots Rolo in the head.  The goblins then attack and almost kill the duo until Fenriic informs them of his job and promises to pay the goblins his reward in exchange for their help.  The goblins agree, and Yark, their navigator, uses a leaf to take them in the right direction.  As they enter a field, Jarlaxle and Yark find a badger, which Jarlaxle insists on keeping, despite it clawing and biting him.  Then, the Owlbear and two cubs enter the field.  The company sneaks over and attacks the Owlbear.  Fenriic misses his first shot while a hail of goblin arrow hit the Owlbear.  One misses, however, and hits the cub.  Jarlaxle decides to help it and runs over to it, attempting to pull the arrow out.  The momma Owlbear does not like this and proceeds to maul Jarlaxle, but he lives.  Jarlaxle runs away from the mom, taking the cub with him.  Fenriic shoots an arrow at the momma owlbear and hits.  Sharp, poisonous vines wrap around the Owlbear, with more arrows hitting it.  Jarlaxle manages to remove the arrow from the cub without hurting it.  The Owlbear moves to Jarlaxle, taking lethal damage from the thorns.  It collapses next to its cub and dies.  A sad Jarlaxle decides to raise the cub (the other one ran away).
    He and Fenriic decided to name the badger Oscar and the Owlbear cub Hoot.  Five goblins, along with Rolo and Yark, were killed.  Jarlaxle wandered off and was attacked by a pack of stirges.  He ran back to the rest of the group, where they proceeded to knock him unconscious and kill all ten remains goblins.  Fenriic was able to kill the stirges and save Jarlaxle, who was on two fails.  They then skinned the Owlbear and started back to Greenest.  However, when Greenest came into view, the heard a loud roar a crack of lightning.

<p class="sessionrecap">
    We open on Brimless, Ori and Ash running back to Greenest, trying to find backup. Out of session, they decided that the best course of action was to leave Cormic in the protection of Edison and the two mercenaries while the others went to get help in Greenest. Once they arrived at Greenest, they met up with Yltzvic (who may or may not had been committing arson while they were gone) and Brimless leaves to go to the bar while everyone else rushes to the Mayor for the backup. But instead of the troops they were expecting as backup, they come face to face with a hobgoblin and a child, around 8 years old. The Mayor informs them that these are the backups, and that it was on a bit of short notice so this was the best they could do. The Mayor also informed them that there’s also a doctor that will be joining them, but he’ll arrive in a few hours. After a little bit of interaction. The party learns a bit more about their new allies. The 8 year old is actually a shadow monk named Jarlaxle (no relation) who has a passion for collecting pets and the hobgoblin is an arcane archer mercenary named Fenriic. While they’re waiting in the town hall for the doctor to arrive, Ori spotted a man who just so happened to be holding a rare flower that she needs to cast an important spells, so she convinces Jarlaxle that the flower is dangerous and needs to be taken away from the man. After a little pestering, Jarlaxle and Ori learn that the man is actually the doctor they’ve been waiting on, and that the flower is a family heirloom. So they collect everyone into one spot and set off. So the team that goes back to the dungeon to save Cormic and Edison is Ori, Ash, Yltzvic, Fenriic, Jarlaxle, and the doctor whose name is Freud. Brimless stays at the bar. They make their way on the path to the dungeon and once they arrive, they go down a different path then they did before.
After barely dodging a few traps, they find a small group of kobolds that warship The Saviors, a group of hero’s who killed their captors (actually the party). The kobolds wouldn’t let the party go unless they joined their Commonwealth. The party eventually persuaded them to let them go, and they went on their way. Eventually, the party finally came across a room that looked familiar. It was the room right outside of Miguel’s lair, the room that had the acid trap on the walls. But taking a few steps farther in the room, the party found the mangled bodies of both Cormic and Edison. Most of the party was confused, as they didn’t know the two dead bodies. But Ori was shaken too her core, and without looking back to the party, she marched toward Miguel’s liar, ready to kill the bastard. She initiated the fight without hesitation, ready to die for her fallen friends, and the rest of the party joined quickly after. It was an incredibly difficult fight, where everyone ways grappled in the roppers tentacles, but Ori managed to get the finishing blow with her rapier. But the fight didn’t have its consequences, as Ori watched as the last of her good friends, Ash, died in her arms. The session ended with the party smashing the dragon eggs, and with Ori promising to bring Ash back.

<p class="sessionrecap">
    This was a poggers session ngl. We start the session off with the party making their way slowly out of the dungeon, and with Ori giving her last goodbye to Cormic, while taking his spell book to remember him by. The moment the party exited the cave though, they were greeted with the sight of a massive floating airship descending closer to them with a halfling sorcerer and shield guardian that the players recognized as Gormon and Herald respectively. Gormon told them that all he wanted was Yltzvic, and wouldn’t hurt anyone else if he was just handed over politely. Ori decided to stand up for him, saying that she wouldn’t let him take her last friend away. So, Gormon decided he would just take Yltzvic by force, lifting him up to the ship with telekinesis. Ori quickly grabbed on to his legs and her plan set in motion. She casted invisibility and minor illusion at the same time to make it look like she was falling but actually stay holding on to his legs. Then, when Gormon placed them both on the ship, she shoved Gormon over the edge. Gormon quickly casted Featherfall on himself but that was just what Ori needed to make her way off the ship, jumping off and using Gormons slowly descending body to take most of the force of the fall, and accident leaving Yltzvic to save himself from Herald and Gormon, who was quickly flying back up to the ship. Yltzvic managed to set fire to the ship and while Gormon was distracted by an arrow from Fenriic, he jumped off the ship toward Ori who managed to catch him. Gormon shouted at them from the ship that they had one this time, but he would be back again to get all of them, and the group continued on toward town, with Ori carrying Ash’s body.
    Once the party finally arrived to town, they got a few simple chores done like. Yltzvic bought a new crossbow, Ori bought a new cloak, and attempted to pawn some of Cormic’s possessions. While on their way to meet the mayor, Ori, Jarlaxle and Yltzvic met a strange man with a sword who goes by Gabriel, that was knocking on random doors and trying to look for info on the Cult of Tiamat. He tells them that he wants to make sure Tiamat’s summoning is complete so he can slay Tiamat himself, and Ori agrees to talk to him more if he meets her in two hours at the local tavern, since she currently has other things to attend to. She and Jarlaxle and Yltzvic went to go meet with the Mayor and receive their next instructions. He told them that they should meet their old pal Leosin in a town called Elturel. There they can exchange information and what to do next in regards to stopping the cult. In the meantime, Ori casts Message to tell Frued and Fenriic to meet her at the local tavern. At the tavern, she asked Frued, Jarlaxle, and Fenriic if they would like to join the team since they had been through a lot together so far and they needed a few more people in the circus since 3 important figures were out of the picture. They agreed, but we’re all reluctant to have actual rolls in the circus. This is also when Ori realized that she would need to take the responsibility of organizing the circus and being the ringleader, a task that she isn’t sure she’s ready to fulfill.
    Around this time, Gabriel barged his way into the tavern and sat down for that meeting that he arranged with Ori. Ori introduced him to the rest of the group, and discussed a few things with him about the dragon cult. He told her that he wants to make sure that the cult succeeds in summoning Tiamat so that she could be slain, and that banishing her again is just delaying the inevitable. He said that he also believes that with the help of Ori’s group, it would be possible to slay Tiamat. Ori reluctantly agreed to allow him to join their traveling group, but knew that he was a suspicious figure that she shouldn’t completely trust. The rest of the night, the party drank away, a toast to completing their mission, and to the friends they’d lost. While Jarlaxle, Frued, and Gabriel stayed sober, Ori, Fenriic and Yltzvic became pretty drunk, and the party was introduced to the emotional mess that is drunk Ori. She rambled about how she wasn’t ready to have to be the new face of the circus now that everyone else who was a major player in it is gone, about how she blames herself for the death of Cormic, Edison, and Ash, and about how she was the one who planted false ideas in Jarlaxle’s mind about Frued’s flower, and how she just wanted it to cast a spell that reminded her of her mother. The next day, everyone woke up strewn across the tavern or in hotel rooms, and the ones who drank payed the massive bill for last night. Ori introduced everyone to the Caravan she calls home, and officially enters them as true members of the Fate’s Fools. And together, Orianna, Jarlaxle, Fenriic, Gabriel, Yltzvic, and Frued all set off to confront the wonders that await them on the road.
