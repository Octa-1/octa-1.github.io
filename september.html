    <h2><bold>9/4/20</bold></h2>
    <p class="sessionrecap">
        The session started where the last one left off, with Orianna standing on the execution stage clutching her mother, while confronting Mavathos, the man who took her family away. The other party members are standing in another stage in the other side of a massive confused crowd that was going to watch the execution. After a little back and forth between the two, Orianna had enough and casted Dissonant Whispers in him while he fought back with strange, ethereal daggers accompanied by the executioner himself who attacked with an axe. Fenriic and Gabriel took this as their cue to just into the fray to diffuse the conflict, as town guards started flooding in to detain Ori and her mother, while Freud ushered Jarlaxle away from the conflict. Ori casted invisibility on her mother while blocking attacks, and told her run, and then properly surrendered herself while telling her allies to surrender or run. They however weren’t ready to comply, as Fenriic kills one of the town guards and Gabriel struggles but both are eventually detained.
        In prison, they’re given some exposition from Ori and Mavathos, telling them that Ori’s parents were arrested by Mavathos for their usage of magic, which is illegal in this town. However, after a little questioning, Ori learned the truth behind the conditions of her parent’s arrest. They had been studying the Feywild, and eventually discovered a powerful creature, a god, trapped there. Eventually, they managed to cross over to the Feywild where they met the god, known as The Traveler. He gave them an offer. They would free him and be his servants in exchange for magical power. So, they tricked him, accepting the deal where he returned the the material plane... straight into a powerful magic circle where he remains trapped to this day. As you could expect, a powerful god being trapped under a town had a massive effect in magic. Now every spell cast in Brimstone draws some chaotic energy from The Traveler, giving it the Wild Magic effect, and making it extremely dangerous and risky to cast spells. When Ori asked about why they hadn’t just released The Traveler to get rid of its effect, he said that it was trapped there with a puzzle no one could solve, and that he himself was using some of The Travelers powers, like the ethereal daggers, to manipulate the town. Right before Mavathos left the prison, after telling them that they would be executed soon, Ori asked where her father is. He told her that he was a little more resistant in the arrest, and that he had to be made an example of.
        Then right after he left, none other then Jarlaxle and Freud showed up. They used Hoot to break the rest of the party out, who all ran straight to Ori’s old home to solve the puzzle, release The Traveler, and expose Mavathos. When they arrived, it was eerie. Everything was just as Ori had left it before she ran away, but it had still changed. A blanket of dust and cobwebs covered everything. The stairway down to the basement had a strange, drawing aura to it. Once everyone went in, they were greeted to a strange elven man in a green cloak who was trapped in some sort of binding circle, with a weird ven-diagram surrounding it. The puzzle proved easy for the creatively thinking party and as they completed it, the circle burst open with blinding light as the strange man and Ori disappeared. The session ended with Ori opening her eyes to place she’d only seen in her dreams: The Feywild, and with Mavathos walking down the basement stairs toward the party, uttering “...so you’ve done it”.

        <h2><bold>9/7/20 (Mini Session?)</bold></h2>
    <p class="sessionrecap">
        Mini session and the return of something called combat? Idk bro pretty wacky. The session started where the last one left off with Ori being teleported to the feywild and the rest of the fates fools being left behind to deal with Mavathos. Mavathos did his villain monologue about how they were ruining his plans by freeing the Traveler and that he would have to kill them right here, right now, as he summoned his shadowy hound companion and prepared for battle. Meanwhile Orianna materializes in the Fey to be confronted with the Traveler himself tap-dancing gleefully on a great stage. After approaching him and asking him where her friends are, he showed her a vision of her friends about to get into a fight with Mavathos. Ori immediately demanded that he send her back to them, knowing how dangerous Mavathos is, but the Traveler refused as he needed a sort of a deal with Ori first. The Traveler still needs her in some way (which wasn’t explained yet) and he decided you give an offer. She would give her soul up to him and spread the word of him, in exchange for returning to the material plane and being given strength, magical power, to finally deal with Mavathos. At first she was reluctant, knowing that if the Traveler needed this deal, she could bend it to her will a little bit and she tried to negotiate. But after seeing another vision of her friends being barraged by ethereal daggers and the evil hound, with Jarlaxle taking the lead in the fight, she realized that she didn’t really have the liberty for deals right now and made the Traveler promise that she would except the deal, but with one exception. Any fuckery done by the Traveler would be done upon her, and her friends would be left out of it. So, they shook hands and the deal was done. So, she began the teleportation back to the material plane and the Traveler gave her a “taste of what’s to come” by sort of taking the back seat in her soul, and giving her a heightened portion of her new warlock powers.
        When she arrived back to the material plane, the party wasn’t looking too good. Gabriel was knocked unconscious while Freud and Fenriic tried their hardest to deal with Mavathos as Jarlaxle finally destroyed the hound with his magical staff. When Mavathos noticed her return, he could see the rage in her eyes as she finished him off with a wave of daggers similar to his own, finally knocking him unconscious. And that's where the session ended.

    <p class="sessionrecap">
        Quicker session, just tying up some loose ends. We start in the basement where Mavathos was defeated, and after a while of debate about what to do with him, the party decided to show mercy to him, dressing him up in a clown costume and leaving his unconscious body with a note, telling him that he had been stripped of his power and was lucky that Orianna didn’t kill him where he stood. While they were deciding this, Jarlaxle looked around the house and found a magical wand that created flowers. Ori also learned that the business card she was given had some magic properties, as after reading, Jarlaxle was charmed by her. After that, the rest of the party started to get ready to hit the road again while Ori looked for her mother. She knew that her neighbors across the road were good friends with her family, so she assumed that her mother might be hiding out there, and she was right. After confirming she was really who she said she was to the neighbors, they let her in where her mother was hiding, safe. They talked for a little bit and caught up with each other, and Ori told her that she was traveling with some good people and that they could take her to a safe place in Waterdeep. She introduced her mother to the group and they got on the road toward Waterdeep.
        On their way, they were attacked by a T. Rex out of nowhere. The party seemed like they were going to lose this fight, not ready for combat, but Gabriel came in clutch with a crit on an upcasted inflict wounds, striking it in the heart and killing it outright. Although when it fell, it crushed their caravan, and the session ended with the party piecing together the remains of the caravan and healing each other

    <p class="sessionrecap">
        pooky ghost session. Gabriel die but it ok he get better. The last session ended with the party’s caravan getting crushed by corpse of a T. Rex. So this session started with the party discussing what they should do next. They knew that they were in the middle of nowhere, with no towns in walking distance for a good while, and it was starting to get late. So they all decided to set up camp for the night. Orianna, Fenriic, and Gabriel decided to take shifts of watch. On Gabriel’s shift, he noticed three ghostly glowing orbs floating towards him. They spoke to him, telling him that they could help him get back on the road if he followed them, but his friends couldn’t come with them. So he followed them, far, far away from his friends toward the edge of a lake... when Gabriel looked into the lake she saw the reflection of four dead bodies of various races, one of which a Fallen Aasimar like Gabriel. The spirits started to speak to Gabe, telling him “this is where we died... fell into the lake... it was an unjust death, it wasn’t our time... and now you will be joining us and our master” as the decaying, acrid corpse of the Aasimar rose from the lake, floating, seeming fueled by some furious necrotic energy. It attacked him, along with the spirits that guided him there.
        The fight was instantly difficult, with the spirits draining his life force and the zombie-like Aasimar shrieking angrily and slashing with its claws. Through certain loose pieces of dialogue said by the Aasimar and spirits during the fight, Gabe was able to put together that the spirits serve the Aasimar ghoul, and they led him back here for the Aasimar to reap him and for his soul to join them. Eventually, the party heard the ruckus and the booming noise of divine smites coming from Gabriel’s attacks, and Ori, Freud, and Fenriic ran to go help, with Jarlaxle a little behind. When they finally arrived they saw Gabriel and the spirits. Right when they arrived, they saw that Gabriel wasn’t doing great. He was staggering. He fought masterfully had slayed the Aasimar by the time his friends arrived, but the spirits were now becoming even more aggressive and Gabriel was drained from the fight with the creature, and pretty quickly after the Aasimar was slain, he finally was knocked down. The rest of the party started attacking the ghosts but their attacks barely landed, passing through them. And eventually, Gabriel couldn’t hold on any more, as his soul lingered away. He woke up surrounded by light. But not a calming, soothing light like a heavenly glow, but a wavy purple light like he was on the inside of a fire. He heard many voices around him, and one talked straight to him specifically, welcoming him in an almost sinister way. It told him that he had now joined them, like they sought out for. When Gabe asked what was going on, the spirit told him this:
        “We were once a party of adventures you see, much like you and your merry band of friends. We were the ones you saw in the lake. And that Aasimar fellow, oh he was much like you. Determined. Likable. arrogant. We were tired of him, so we killed him and through him in the lake. But, alas, he got his revenge, kept our souls trapped here with him. But one day, if we collect enough souls to be part of us, we will be free!”
        “What do I do! How do I get out of here! I need to leave now!!”
        “Sorry, you’re trapped here now like the rest of us. Although, there may be another way...”
        “Yes..?”
        “You have a strong soul don’t you. What if we, say, come along with you. You will take us with you, we will bring our pursuit to the outside world. No longer will we need to lure people here.”
        “Are you saying you want control of my body? For me to be your puppet?!”
        “Oh no no, we will not interfere with you. You just need to bring us souls. We have a quota to hit to return to our bodies, you know”
        “No! I won’t help you! You people are evil, you killed your friend and you deserve to be trapped here with him. I just wanted to put him to rest!”
        “Ah, but don’t you have a mission to complete? To kill Tiamat? How will you do that from here, you’re just another one of us. Don’t you want to honor your oath?”
        “Fine. I’ll do it. But I WILL find a way to get rid of you. You won’t be with me for long”
        “...we’ll see...”
        And with that, the countless souls all as one conglomerate enter his body, taking a sort of backseat in his own soul. He wakes up, alive as ever, with his friends leaning over him making sure he’s ok. He tells them he’s fine, and that he should start fixing up the caravan as he needs a moment to himself at the lake. After they leave, he sits by the lake, and speaks toward where the Aasimar was and starts a prayer toward his God. The spirit of the Aasimar responded back saying “not many are as kind as you my friend. Farewell.” And he received inspiration (along with the Hallowed One feat for being revived from the dead in a way other then a spell). After that he went back to his friends, helped them repair the rest of the caravan, and they hit the road toward Waterdeep. Gabriel now has a new challenge to overcome, but he’s gonna have to just roll with it

        <h2><bold>9/25/20</bold></h2>
        <p class="sessionrecap">
            God. sniff I almost cried. The session started with the party finally arriving at their destination, Waterdeep. The first thing they do upon arrival is visit the world-famous tavern known as the Yawning Portal. Once they get there they realize that the tavern is a little more lively then they expected, seeming like the medieval version of a rave. The bouncer outside is easily shrugged off with Ori’s new Magic Fake I.D. and once they get inside it’s even MORE lively then they thought. Ori tells Jarlaxle to pass off as a halfling if possible. There are people dancing and yelling and cheering everywhere and above the Portal itself is some magical smoke, showing the shape of a bearded wizard fighting a group of 6 heros, and eventually being dragged into the ground by ethereal chains. Upon seeing that, the tavern roared with cheers as a short halfling and an arcane golem emerge from the smoke. Gorman and Herald in the flesh. Yltzvic immediately hides, but the rest of the party doesn’t, and Gormon takes no notice of them. He seems to be pretty well received by the crowd, no one is booing him like they would have if it was Halaster. So, Jarlaxle goes to sit down next to him and talk. Gormon takes a major liking to him, assuming he is also a halfling like himself, and offers to hang out with him in his airship. Jarlaxle politely declines but Gormon wouldn’t take no for an answer, so he immediately has Herald grab him and fly him up to his ship, and he flies up along with Herald with his dragon wings. After taking him up to the ship, he quickly got bored and dropped Jarlaxle from all the way up in his airship down to the ground. But luckily, with his monk training, he manages to stick the landing and took minimal damage.
            After that, they took the rest of their night’s drinking to the Tacksfrod Tavern, a location that quickly garnered a lot more fame due to it being owned by the heros who ended Halaster’s reign of power. After hanging there for a bit, they get a message from a Drow named Helios, telling them that the gnome across the street (I forgot his real name, I’ll be calling him PG for purple gnome and it’s just funny how little the name PG fits him :skull:) saying that he has information that may be important for them. So, in the morning on the next day, the party visited Ol’ PG’s shop. He told them that he had information for them, but only if “Jarlaxle could... rearrange his closet for him...” and if he did then they would get the info. Ori questioned him on this for a while until Gabe got impatient and decided to just do it himself. I’m not gonna go in to too much detail of what happened next but... luckily not too much did. Gabe went into the closet, and PG followed him in. There was a loud slamming noise and the door burst open with Gabe holding PG by the back of his shirt, saying he “tried to do something to him”. The party got him arrested and in jail, Ori got the information they needed out of him. He said that there’s a lizardfolk who may be able to help him who owns his own shop here in Waterdeep. His name is Snapjaw, and apparently his shop is sort of hard to come by. They eventually manage to find it and when they talk to Snapjaw, he reveals that he is a double agent, acting as a spy for the rebellion against the cult, inside the walls of the cult’s main stronghold, which is in a swamp. He told them that he can bring them there and together they can take down the base.
            While Snapjaw left to get prepared for the travel, Freud and Nawala, Ori’s mother, stood in the doorway. Freud said that he has personal business that he needs to attend to, and that Nawala would be joining him, and he handed Jarlaxle a letter before quickly trying to leave through the door. Ori asked if they would ever see him again, and he told her to read the note. Now I’m not gonna post the whole note here, there will be a link to it under this, but it’s really hard to describe in text that this was a really somber moment. Deep down, the party all knew the most likely wouldn’t see him again. It was very sad, but also happy as Freud was finally standing for himself and doing what he feels like he needs to do. So, with that quick farewell, the party prepared to leave for their next location. They may have lost one great friend, but maybe they’ll gain another in Snapjaw. One thing is for sure, the next stage of their adventure has just begun.
