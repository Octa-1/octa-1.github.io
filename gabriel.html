        Hey I’m Gus and I play Gabriel Saryan, a fallen aasimar paladin who’s fall from grace led him to the fates fools. Gabriel’s story begins with him as a divine servant of Savras, the goddess of fate and divination. All was great for him until he did the greatest sin he could do: he looked at his own fate. Savras of course revoked his life as a divine servant and Gabe fell from grace. Savras also gave him an impossible quest in order to be forgiven: kill Tiamat, she never really believed he could achieve this, it was more of a “when pigs fly” sort of thing. Gabe accepted this task and has been trying to complete it ever since. But just recently, he was slain by a large amalgamation of spirits. He made a deal with them that he could continue to live, but they would reside within his soul, forcing him to kill for them to grow in power and hopefully one day be free.
