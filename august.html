    <h2><bold>Mini Session 2 (Jarlaxle)</bold></h2>
    <p class="sessionrecap">
        Was travelling with young child (Jarlaxle) when he suddenly collapsed without warning. He was immediately rushed into the caravan and laid down, with no obvious wounds. The child seemed to have steady functions, and upon further examinations the body was determined to have no punctures whatsoever. After roughly 2 hours, the child awoke in a cold sweat. Upon waking up, he screamed about dragons, akin to someone waking up from a bad dream. He seemed to think that all of our travelling companions had been killed by a dragon. Upon further interrogation, the child claimed to have searched the woods for his pet badger (which, to the extent of my knowledge, never left the caravan - damned thing!) when he encountered a strange man wielding a magical staff and wearing a metal mask, similar to one a blacksmith would wear. The man knocked his friend Orianna (last name unknown), who also never left the caravan, unconscious, then struck his staff on the ground and blacked the subject unconscious. When the subject "woke up" from this unconsciousness, the subject claimed to see his future - a white dragon freezing all us chaps to death. The next thing he saw, he was with us. Next to him laid a staff that he said was in his fever dream, so immediately grabbed it which rapidly tensed up his muscles, which seemed to cause him to reverse his course and claim it was a nonmagical staff.
    
        Hypothesis:
        Child is likely severely brain damaged/traumatized, causing him to hallucinate and reform these now-unlocked memories of his past. The threat of this dragon cult we are now fighting combined with the trauma of having to leave his family could likely cause him to hallucinate things that reflect his trauma, such as his makeshift "family" of the caravan all dying a grisly death. Subject should likely seek further help in the form of psychoanalysis/intensive therapy. Will inform the viewer further upon further analysis

    <p class="sessionrecap">
        Anyways the session starts with the party still on the road in the caravan, it had been about 2-3 days since we left Greenest. It was around mid-day when the party arrived to Beregost, their next rest stop, and a place where Freud said he had business to attend to. It was a pretty large town, comparatively to Greenest, yet it was strangely empty, with only the occasional commoner passing by, many of the houses looking empty. Freud immediately hopped out of the caravan when they arrived and went off around the town, clearly looking for something or someone. Ori and Jarlaxle decided to follow him, asking Gabriel to keep watch of the caravan or look for a place to stay for the night. After asking Freud what he was doing, they found out that he was looking for the towns Mayor for private, personal reasons, but everyone in the town told him that they’ve never had a Mayor, which Freud was sure was false. They decided to make their way to the large mansion over the town, on a hill, which all the town folks also said no one ever lived in. Meanwhile, back with Gabriel and Brimless at the caravan, (Yltzvic had decided to wander town and Fenriic was mysterious absent, on his own job) a halfling man approached, offering rooms at his tavern for the travelers. They both accepted, and followed him there to meet his wife, also a halfling, and purchase a few rooms. The owner started drawing Gabriel and Brimless, and asked for physical descriptions of the others.
        Back to Ori, Jarlaxle, and Freud. Upon arrival the the mansion in the hill, they realized it seemed as thought no one had lived here for months, however the claim that no one ever lived there could not be true, as it was still mostly well taken care of. After Freud busted down the gate, Ori tried to open up the locked door as Jarlaxle took Freud aside and tried to get out of him what he came here for. Freud reluctantly told him that in this town, his mother was killed because she was suspected to be a witch. And Freud wanted to get payback. From inspecting the door, and the outside of the house, Ori decided that it would be best if the whole party was here for this. So she ran to retrieve them and found Yltzvic, Brimless, and Gabriel at the tavern. The tavern owner drew Ori’s face as well, and when Ori questioned him on it he said it was “just so he can remember”. She brushed it off and dragged the others over to mansion, where she saw Jarlaxle and Freud, scratched and scarred in places they weren’t before she left. When she asked what happened, they told her that they don’t remember and that they probably just tripped or something. Once Brimless knocked down the door the party entered and found a few suspicious things. For one, there was a family portrait hanging upstairs which showed a mother, father, and son. There were 2 beds in the children’s room, despite the portrait only showing one child. The main thing that felt off was that when Ori and Gabriel walked past the large window upstairs, they felt watched, like something was peering at them. They both tried certain abilities to detect for any magical presence, both of which came up short. The party soon after left the mansion with no leads on what happened to them, but they all collectively agreed that something was very off. It was getting late however, so the most of the party decided they would continue their investigation tomorrow morning
        Ori however, still had some personal business to attend to in this town, and Gabriel decided to accompany her. Ori wanted to take Ash’s body to the towns cleric, to get his body blessed and stop it from decaying so that she could bring him back in tip-top condition. On their way, Gabriel asked Ori if this town made her feel... weird too, being the only other magic user. She agreed with him that there’s something off, but she can’t put her finger on it and that she wants to leave next morning. They arrived at the temple, and left ash’s body to to be blessed over night, although the temple was strange too. The two of them made their way back to the tavern, and Gabriel revealed to Ori that he wasn’t on great terms with his own god, Savras. That night, Ori slept in the only room that had one bed, without anyone else. She had an awful... “dream”. In her room we’re blood splatters, all over the floor in the middle of the room, leading out of the slightly opened door like something was dragged out. Ori cautiously climbed out of peered our the door into the hallway where she saw an awful, fleshy abomination with three long necks and ghastly, elongated human-like heads on each neck, all of its teeth covered in blood. The of the heads was tearing into a dead female gnome on the floor, that the blood path followed up to. One of the heads reached out to bite her but she woke up in a cold sweat before it hit her, still in her bed with a bruise in her head and traces of blood around her room. The moment she woke up from the dream she ran into the hallway (where a gross monster and pile of blood wasn’t) and checked on everyone, making sure they’re ok. When everyone asked what was wrong, she realized she... wasn’t sure. She knew she had a dream, but it was fading away quickly, leaving her with nothing but a sense of dread. She apologized to everyone for waking them and walked downstairs to the actual bar part for breakfast and a hardy tankard of ale to think over.
        When the owner came out from the kitchen, to serve her, she noticed his wife wasn’t there and asked him here she went. He was very confused at this question, claiming he never had a wife. And Ori quickly realized that this was true. He never did have a wife. Must have just been another dream she had last night. Everyone else came downstairs quickly and the party ate a nice breakfast together, starting a conversation with the owner. During the conversation, he pulled out his lunch menu and showed them that the local kids must have been messing with him because the menu said “help me it is watching me right now” in messy ink on it. Apparently, stuff like this happened all the time because the owner seemed fairly unfazed by the disturbing message. Before the party could question it more, they heard a scream coming from a woman outside and they all instinctively ran out to help. By the time they got to her, she was not longer screaming and was just standing back up and dusting himself off. When the party asked her if she was ok she claimed that she was fine, she just got startled by something. She didn’t remember what though. She described it like waking up from a dream and knowing something awful happened, but not being able to remember what. Ori immediately knew the feeling she was talking about and decided something was really really wrong in this town. She asked the woman to to lead her on the oath she just walked. She showed them that she was waking through an ally way when she got startled, but nothing else really stuck out to the party as odd. They did, however, meet a strange man while they were walking with the woman. He was clearly insane, screaming rambles about a thing, a monster in the streets that was taking people and no one was noticing. The party questioned him more, and he described to them what he’s seen.
        He told them that it’s a multi-headed creature that slinks in the shadows and strikes when one is alone, singing it’s magical song and causing people not to see it. When asked how he could see it, he took of his hood and showed that the had cut off his ears, damaging them enough to stop him from hearing the song. With that information, the party set up a plan to find this thing, if it exists at all, and free the town of it. And thaaaaaaaats where the session ended. I probably forgot stuff in there sorry will

        <h2><bold>8/8/20</bold></h2>
    <p class="sessionrecap">
        the session started where the last one ended with the party discussing what to do next. Midway through their conversation, they felt a deafening silence (I forgot to mention this in the last one but there’s a deafening silence whenever the creature takes another victim) which they ignored, not knowing that Brimless had just been taken by the false hydra. The rest of the party decided that the best course of action was to find the towns largest building and look for something in the streets from above. The tallest building just so happened to be the same temple that Ori got Ash’s body blessed at the night before, so they went to give it a try. Turns out, the highest spot was their bell, and only high ranking monks are allowed up there. Jarlaxle managed to convince them that he’s a monk of Lathander, and he was allowed access while everyone else had to stay back. On his way to the highest point, Jarlaxle found a basket of beautiful, crisp golden apples and couldn’t resist the temptation of taking a bite. The apples turned out to be holy in nature, blessed by Lathander, and they blinded him with their radiant light, causing him to stumble down the stairs right at the feet of the high priest himself, who’s meditation was disturbed by Jarlaxles bumbling. The high priest tried to grab him and struggled to pin him down causing a small fight between the two causing the rest of the party to check behind the curtains to the high priests meditation room to see what was going on. The high priest explained to them that Jarlaxle had eaten one of the sacred apples and was in a reserved part of the temple. Ori grabbed Jarlaxle our of his arms and tried to brush it of by saying he was her son and that they were just on her way out but as she was walking away the high priest made a remark about her infernal blood. In retaliation, Ori casted a spell against the priest as a warning strike to scare him and accidentally killed him.
        This turned the next hour and a half into a spiral of blame, excuses, and lies as the party stumbled on what to do next. Ori casted Invisibility and started to book it, advising the others to do the same. Right after she did that, a lesser monk entered the meditation room and saw the dead priest. Before the party could talk to him, convince him to leave, or run, Yltzvic stabbed him dead in one strike and fled the room. The other three weren’t so lucky, as they got arrested quickly. Luckily, after some good persuasion checks, bad insight checks, and a little help from Ori, the temple collectively decided that the stabbed monk had eaten one of the apples and his stomach exploded and that the priest died of a heart attack after seeing that. Jarlaxle mentioned that he ate an apple, and asked if his stomach would explode too and one of the monks told him it would and that he didn’t have much time left. The party decided to group up with Freud, who stayed with the screaming woman from last session, and begin figuring out another plan. While they were meeting up with each other, another deafening silence was felt by the whole party as the memory of Hoot started to fade away into nothing. They asked Freud if he could see what was wrong with Jarlaxle, but he told them that he doesn’t specialize in magic and all he can suggest is a good amount of rest. So, much to some of the groups dismay, they decided to call it a day and rest up back at the inn. While some of the party (Ori, Fenriic, and Yltzvic) decided to stay up a bit, Jarlaxle, Freud, and Gabriel went to bed early. While Jarlaxle was sleeping (in the same room as Freud), Freud loomed over him with a pillow and tried to suffocate him. With a bit of struggle, Jarlaxle knocked Freud out and ran out into the tavern for help. The party decided that it wasn’t safe for Jarlaxle to sleep alone with Freud, so they changed up their room partners.
        Jarlaxle and Ori would sleep in a room, Fenriic and Yltzvic would sleep in a room, and Freud and Gabriel would sleep in a room (at this point everyone who was staying up went to bed). While Jarlaxle was settling down into his new room, the one Ori was sleeping alone in last night, he found something strange. An adventurers pack next to the empty bed, and other items that seem to belong to and explorer. When the two went through the bag more they realized it belonged to a female gnome, a cleric most likely, who according to diaries and notes used to travel in their circus. Her diary describes her Friends Jarlaxle, Ori, Yltzvic, Fenriic, Freud and Gabriel in vivid detail, and someone named Brimless. She claimed to have traveled with them, been with them for a very long time and even consider them a family. It describes them arriving at Greenest, surviving a dragon attack, raiding a dragon cult base and loosing her friends Cormic, Edison, and Ash. It describes her arriving at a strange town with an empty mansion called Beregost. But as the notes went on from there, they got more and more deranged, rambling about a monster, repeating the same phrase. “Don’t listen to its song”. Out of character, we all realized this was the gnome from Ori’s “dream” and that she had always known us but died from the False Hydra and caused us to forget. At this point Ori was the only one still reading. It was around the middle of the night and everyone else was asleep but Ori was staying up, trying to find info on this person. She had taken pieces of fabric and turned them into makeshift ear plugs to block out this so called “song”. A little later into the night, Ori saw something. A three-headed creature peering at her from her open window, slinking it’s way inside, before realizing Ori could see it and fleeing. But needless to say, this time Ori remembered. The session ended with Ori standing defensively in front of Jarlaxle and feeling another deafening silence

    <p class="sessionrecap">
        Shoutout to the homies who actually showed up to this one you’re the real bros. The session started where the last one left off, with Ori staring down a singular head of the beast that had been haunting the group ever since they arrived in Beregost. It had made its way to the other side of the street when it realized Ori could see it and started watching, sitting unflinchingly for hours. Eventually, she woke up Jarlaxle and told him to get the others (just Freud and Gabriel). All three of them were given ear plugs and Ori explained to them how the past few hours he had been staring, and that this must have been the creature they learned about in the abandoned library. She also explained to them that the way she figured out that they needed ear plugs was from Kippers notes (poor Kipper). They eventually decided to suit up and go outside to finally confront this thing, but we’re a little reluctant on bringing Jarlaxle as he seemed pretty scared. They eventually traced it back to an open sewer grate and climbed inside the sewers to follow it back to its layer. After hours of trudging through sludge and waste (and Seth shipping Ori and Gabriel) they finally arrived at something. It was a pile of what seemed to be human and animal remains, and something was shuffling around under it. After a little suspense, it was revealed to be Hoot who somehow barely survived the False Hydra. Before the group could get aquatinted with the return of their animal friend, the False Hydra quickly attacked. The fight was tough, as it’s necks quickly coiled around the party an the head bit into their flesh. Ori’s many attempts to charm or curse the creature were foiled by its surprisingly high mental skills. Eventually, a powerful divine smite from Gabriel sliced its heads off but not before Freud unfortunately was taken out. When Gabriel tried to heal him, his body was unresponsive to the magic and felt cold. And that’s where the session ended.

        <h2><bold>8/16/20</bold></h2>
    <p class="sessionrecap">
        Very role play heavy session, it was pretty much just role play not a single combat encounter and every few skill checks. So idk how that will translate into this recap. Anyways, the session picked up where the last one left off with the party having just killed the False Hydra and with Freud being unresponsive. After a little more magical healing Ori recognized he was in a state of shock, having been in his first fight ever and almost dying, but he was still alive. They took him and Hoot back to the caravan where everyone fell asleep, exhausted from the fight, ready to depart the next day. In the morning the party got hit the road to Elturel, which was the city they were told to meet Leosin at by the Governor in Greenest what seemed like ages ago. The destination was only about two days away so the party got to interact and grow closer a lot on the way without being interrupted by dead gods and unholy monsters. Early on in the trip, Ori realized that once they arrived at Elturel they would have to preform, and it would not only be Ori’s first time as the ringleader but also her first time working with a whole new team with no established routine. Needless to say, she was a little stressed. She worked with Jarlaxle, Gabriel, and Hoot on what their roles would be. Gabriel would read fortunes, drawing from his divine power as an Aasimar of Savras, god of fate. Jarlaxle would use his dancing lights and acrobatics, and would also work with Hoot to have him do little tricks like jump through hoops. Ori was pretty happy with this, but knew it needed a lot more work and structure, as well as just something more.
    While they were working things out Ori decided to show off a new trick she hadn’t used yet. She casted Speak With Animals and talked to Hoot, how had a more polite tone then expected but was still very much an owlbear, always focused on his next meal. She spoke to him about the circus and asked if he would be ok with being in it, and he said that he would as long as he got plenty of extra food. She also asked about what he thought of Jarlaxle, to which Hoot replied with “he’s a nice boy, I would prefer if he was less controlling though”. She also tried talking to Oscar and the horses, to no avail. Eventually, after two days of travel, they arrived at the gates of Elturel which was being guarded by boarder security, which was pretty much just one man. He questioned them about the nature of their visit and about the... owlbear cub in their caravan. He told them that there was no way he could allow Hoot into the city without proof of regeneration. Ori defused the conflict with some magical seduction (charm person) and they carried on into the city with a few thing in their mind. Finding Leosin, finding a place to sleep, finding where to preform, and finding out what the deal was with the massive floating orb in the sky. They knocked out two of those at once when Freud recommended his favorite local tavern, A Pair Of Black Antlers, and introduced the party to the bartender who was his good friend. He gave the party free rooms and informed them a little about the city, telling them that the orb in the sky was conjured by a powerful cleric in the city to ward off undead.
    Anyways, Freud is actually a local to Elturel and he told the party about a doctors club that he was part of, just a group of doctors in the city that meet up under this very tavern every now and then and pretty soon would be one of their meetings. He asked Jarlaxle if he could take Hoot to the meeting and show Hoot to his doctor friends and do some “medicinal tests” on him, which Jarlaxle was nervous about but reluctantly agreed to as long as Hoot wasn’t hurt. It was made even more suspicious by the fact that the club met in a secret room under a trap door that they weren’t allowed into. The took Hoot down there for the meeting later and the party left to go look for Leosin and a place to preform. On their way they found the local church and asked them what they knew if Jarlaxle’s glowing. The nun said that it was an awful curse of Lathander that will cause him to glow brighter and brighter until he’s nothing but light, but had not intel on how to get rid of it. Eventually while looking through Cormic’s notes, she realized she place to go to for the show was the High Hall where they met the man who crated the magical sphere. He’s a bit of a local celebrity, not even a local celebrity he’s a hero, but his magical power was mostly drained by creating the orb, also known as the Companion. He told the party that they would be preforming at the High Hall and that he would be amongst the audience. After dealing with that, the party went back to APOBA to meet and Leosin and his friend, who’s name I forget rn but he IS important, in order to discuss plans for the future in regards to dealing with the dragon cult. It turns out Leosins friend was quite a partier and refused to talk until the party showed him how to have a good time. He quickly took a likening to Ori and also grew quite fond with Jarlaxle and Gabriel. And so, the party drank the night away with their new friend, pretty much forgetting about the plans they met up to make.
    And that’s where the session ended.

        <h2><bold>8/22/20</bold></h2>
    <p class="sessionrecap">
        Today the party finally embraces their inner clown. The session started where it left off with everyone drinking and tired and with Jarlaxle locked in the basement. In the middle of the night Ori realized that she hadn’t seen Jarlaxle and went into a panic trying to find him. Eventually he managed to get out when the doctor club or whatever it’s called went to let him out (Fenriic showed back up too). In the morning, the party planned for their first performance as a new team. Ori was stressed out of her mind about it because not only was it her first time as ringleader but it was her first time working with this group and it was a performance for high ranking nobles. They decided that Fenriic would show off his archery, then shoot an arrow at Thavious Kreeg, the most influential noble in the stands, and Jarlaxle would catch it in midair. Jarlaxle then would go on to show off his acrobatic skills. Then, for the grand finale, Gabriel and Hoot would have an epic (fake) battle. It was difficult to convince Hoot to do it, and to not just kill Gabriel, but after promising as much food as he wanted he complied. Jarlaxle also insisted on a petting zoo for Oscar (pretty sure he was the imposter trying to sabotage us ngl). The show went on as a great success to the relief of Ori and the rest of the party, and they made a good about of gold from it too, dedicating some of it to food for Hoot.
        The party then went to go find Leosin’s friend (I’m sorry will I forgot his name again I’ll start writing them down during the session) because they remembered that they never got the info they needed, while Jarlaxle went to go buy some goats and dogs with his money. They were told to go to Baldur’s Gate next, as a group of Dragon Cultists are traveling in disguise among normal people on their way there. They were also told that they might need to rebrand for a bit, change their names and outfits so they aren’t noticed while traveling. So, they got on their way, boarding a boat that would go along the river toward Baldur’s Gate, and Ori made quick friends with the wood elf captain. Everyone settled down, counted their earnings, and relaxed after finally having a good win for once as their ship slowly drifted toward their next adventure. And that’s where the session ended.

        <h2><bold>8/29/20</bold></h2>
    <p class="sessionrecap">
        Anyways, the session starts where the last one left off, with the crew relaxing on a boat on their way to Baldur’s Gate (accompanied by Yltzvic this time). Everyone was off doing their own thing until they all heard a loud roar coming from the storage area below. They ran toward it as quickly as they could to find Jarlaxle being attacked by a hungry Hoot who was angry over Jarlaxle taking away the remaining goats he was trying to eat. The party tried to hold him back and pretty much entirely failed until Freud of all people came in clutch by throwing a strange looking metal orb at Hoot, causing Hoot to instantly disappear. He explained that it was a magical item he had been working on while he was studying Hoot in Elturel and that it manipulates the primal ki inside of all animals to send them to a dormant demiplane inside the orb. Essentially, a Pokéball that he gave to Jarlaxle as thanks for letting him research Hoot for him to keep Hoot inside of when they’re in busy towns or places where an owlbear wouldn’t exactly be expectable. For the rest of the boat ride everyone relaxed, knowing that once they arrived at their destination they would have some investigation to do.
        After about a day more of travel they finally arrived at Baldur’s Gate, the largest city in the Sword Coast. While it definitely isn’t as well kept as Elturel, Baldur’s Gate was definitely an intimidating place to look for the Dragon Cult due to its sheer size. After a while of searching Ori eventually noticed a group of what seemed to be simple traders that she definitely recognized from her first visit to the camp. She was about to confront them but she realized that as the only person in the group that had attacked the camp in the past, she would need a disguise as not to be recognized. With a nice tux, some makeup, and a top hat, she pulled off a pretty posh elf. She and Gabriel confronted the suspected cultists as they were loading containers of food from one cart to another. Orianna managed to convince them that she was Baldur’s Gate’s top detective and that Gabriel was her powerful bodyguard, and there here was an investigation happening in town. After a bit of questioning, she confirmed that they’re on their way to Waterdeep but they never admitted that they were Dragon Cultists.
        After returning back to the rest of the group Fenriic mentioned another detail that Gabe and Ori failed to notice, a more expensive, luxury looking carriage. Fenriic had noticed that there seemed to be either a black-scaled Half Dragon within. So Ori and Gabriel, being the charisma tanks they are, went back to the cultist (who the party were now assuming we’re guards) and intimidated them into letting them speak to the Half Dragon, although they seemed very unhappy to do so saying “she really won’t be pleased with this”. Apon stepping into the carriage they came face to face with Rezmir, one of the five leaders of the Dragon Cult. After a while of back and forth and interrogation, Ori told her that she knew who she was, causing Rezmir to initiate her escape. One of her associates, who Ori recognized as Rath Modar, a red  wizard, helped her teleport away. Gabe and Ori both ran out of the carriage only to be confronted by the rest of the cultists ready to attack with pikes, telling them that “they should keep this between you and me”. Ori almost started a fight, but realized for once that their numbers were too large in too highly populated of an area for a conflict to break out, so they walked away back to the rest of the party catching them up on what they missed. With nothing else to do other then keep moving, following the group of cultists who are now without their leader, the party departed on their way to Waterdeep.
        Ok this part is gonna be kinda weird for me because it’s just me writing about my own arc but please humor me, pretend it’s someone else writing this.
        After about a week on the road, the party approached their next pit stop. Orianna knew this destination was coming but pushed it out of her mind, trying not to think about it, all until now. A seemingly bright town, mostly populated by tieflings, named Brimstone. Ori’s hometown. She hadn’t told anyone that she was from here however (although Cormic obviously knew and I feel like Edison would have known, and she spoke to Freud before arriving in a way where he could assume this was her hometown). They were greeted by a sort of welcoming committee who told them about the festival that the party would be performing at. Immediately after arriving Ori left the party for a little to visit her old home, which she assumed would be torn down or given to a new family. Instead, it was barred and chained up, almost as if under high security. She decided that she would come back after the performance tomorrow morning and joined her friends. They were all settling down in the local inn and getting ready to finally sleep in a normal bed for the first time in a while (the room arrangement was Jarlaxle and Freud, Fenriic and Yltzvic, and Gabriel and Ori) when Ori heard a knock at the door. She cracked the door open and saw the familiar face of the town’s mayor. They had a high-tension little conversation, catching up a bit, with Ori making it clear that she still hadn’t fully forgiven him for what he’d done to her family. Before he left she asked him about the house and about why it’s all locked up. He told her that “we found a new use for it” before going to the rest of the rooms to introduce himself to the rest of the party.
        The next morning the party performed at the festival, mostly acing the show, although Ori was a little more distracted then usual. After the show was over, the mayor presented himself before the crowd saying that there was one more show for the day. He said that a criminal had tried to escape the prison the night before, and that the said prisoner would be used as an example with a public execution. And dragged up to the podium to be killed was none other then Nawala Roza, Ori’s mother. In pure rage Ori managed to crash her way on to the stage and shove the executioner aside, while freeing her mother. The session ended with the Mayer in pure anime fashion saying “...you truly are just like your mother”.
