        Hey my name is Sam and I’m playing Orianna Rosa, the bard extraordinaire! She’s a charismatic tiefling with purple skin who knows her way around people but can sometimes make really shit choices with her life. She’s the ringleader of the party’s circus, which she has worked in all her life, and she’s always making sure her friends are happy and healthy, while casting spells with a style derived from the Feywild. But even though she tries to help her friends with their problems, she has a slew of her own issues. So many people close to her have left her, whether they’ve died or had to go their own way, and she blames herself for a lot of it. She’s getting a bit better, but with Freud leaving the party she’s afraid that this is the start of the end for another one of her failed, makeshift families. Not only that, but in her last attempt to make peace with her past she was forced into signing an eldritch pact with a powerful Fey god known as the Traveler, who is tied to her family. Now the one thing in life she can control, herself, is being played with like a toy by a stronger being. Regardless, she tries to be as chipper as she can and never breaks a promise to someone close to her. In fact, her current main goal is to revive a dead friend who she promised to keep alive.
