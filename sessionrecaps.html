<p>7/10/20: The session started where the last one left off, as the party dragged their new friend Leosin, a monk who’s and expert on dragon cults, back towards Greenest. On the road he told them that in his time at the camp he discovered that there was a hidden cave that was holding a ton of dragon eggs that would be used as an army of dragons. Once they finally arrived they split up to complete two different tasks. Cormic and Ash brought Leosin to meet Nesim Waladra, who is a good friend to Leosin and was the one who sent the group to come find him. Brimless leaves to calm his nerves at the tavern. Orianna and Edison go to see the governor and tell him what they learned but they can’t get past his receptionist so they schedule a meeting for 3 tomorrow. Eventually, both groups start to hear civilians screaming from the tavern as they realize Brimless had gone into a blind rampage of fear when seeing the costumers dressed up in Mind Flayer costumes. Ori is the first one to get there and ends the conflict with a Calm Emotions spell. The party cheers up Brimless, apologizes to the commoners before going to sleep.
    The next day they head over to the local “eating shop” for breakfast. The owner tells them about a jar of pickles that they have that the store is famous for. No one has ever been able to open it. Every famous wizard or adventurer have tried their hand at it and failed. After trying for a while the party leaves and Ori and Edison go to meet the Governor. He tells them that they came back in one piece but the cult is a bigger threat then they thought and that they’re raising an army of dragons. The Governor rewards each party member with 250 gp. After getting their cash and resting up, the party set out to raid the camp. 
    The trek to the camp was eerily empty, and the camp was even more empty. It seemed like it had been abandoned. Once they entered the cave though, they found where everyone went as they were attacked by a group of Dragonclaw cultists.
    After dealing with them, the party found a split in the road with a door on one wall. Orianna entered the room on her own and came face to face with the one she wanted to fight most, Mondath. Mondath called in 11 guards that the rest of the party held off while Ori battled it out with her. The fight was tough but in the end Mondath knocked out Ori and Ash, who ran in to help. She was then finished off by Edison and Cormic who arrived after finally finishing off the guards. And that is where the sessions ended.

    7/17/2020: The session starts up where we ended last time, with the party recovering from the battle with Mondath, many of them being severely damaged. After searching the room Mondath was in, the party found maps describing the Dragon Cults next plan of attack. Once everyone was healed, the party continued onward deeper into the dungeon, eventually coming across a trap door leading to a new area. After looking around for a bit they find a statue depicting Tiamat, the lord of dragons, with a chest sitting at the bottom. Attempting to open the chest triggered a trap, spraying acid gas from the walls that incapacitate Cormic and Edison, who were still damaged from the previous fight. Orianna, Brimless, and Ash carry their fallen allies to what they think is an escape as the gas follows them, but it ends up a dead end. A clutch investigation check from Orianna reveals another trap door, this time in the ceiling. After climbing through it, they barely have a moment to catch their breath before turning a corner to come face to face with Cyanwrath and three of his guards. Cyanwrath promises safety to everyone if he can finish his dual with Brimless uninterrupted. Brimless agrees with the terms that no weapons will be used. The fight begins, and Cyanwrath knocks Brimless to his feet with a lightning breath attack in an instant. Ori runs over to help an unconscious Brimless but is attacked by Cyanwrath for interrupting the fight, knocking her out, and triggering Cormic and Ash to go on the offensive. The fight begins, as Edison manages to wake up and each of the three are restrained by a guard while Cyanwrath forces them to watch him kill Brimless. But before he can, Brimless wakes back up and gets a good hit in while the Cormic, Ash, and Edison the guards. Eventually, Brimless is downed again and Ash manages to take the last hit on Cyanwrath, shooting a flaming crossbow bolt through his heart. After Cyanwrath is killed, the two remaining bodyguards reveal that</p>
