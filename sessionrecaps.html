    The session started where the last one left off, as the party dragged their new friend Leosin, a monk who’s and expert on dragon cults, back towards Greenest. On the road he told them that in his time at the camp he discovered that there was a hidden cave that was holding a ton of dragon eggs that would be used as an army of dragons. Once they finally arrived they split up to complete two different tasks. Cormic and Ash brought Leosin to meet Nesim Waladra, who is a good friend to Leosin and was the one who sent the group to come find him. Brimless leaves to calm his nerves at the tavern. Orianna and Edison go to see the governor and tell him what they learned but they can’t get past his receptionist so they schedule a meeting for 3 tomorrow. Eventually, both groups start to hear civilians screaming from the tavern as they realize Brimless had gone into a blind rampage of fear when seeing the costumers dressed up in Mind Flayer costumes. Ori is the first one to get there and ends the conflict with a Calm Emotions spell. The party cheers up Brimless, apologizes to the commoners before going to sleep.
    The next day they head over to the local “eating shop” for breakfast. The owner tells them about a jar of pickles that they have that the store is famous for. No one has ever been able to open it. Every famous wizard or adventurer have tried their hand at it and failed. After trying for a while the party leaves and Ori and Edison go to meet the Governor. He tells them that they came back in one piece but the cult is a bigger threat then they thought and that they’re raising an army of dragons. The Governor rewards each party member with 250 gp. After getting their cash and resting up, the party set out to raid the camp. 
    The trek to the camp was eerily empty, and the camp was even more empty. It seemed like it had been abandoned. Once they entered the cave though, they found where everyone went as they were attacked by a group of Dragonclaw cultists.
    After dealing with them, the party found a split in the road with a door on one wall. Orianna entered the room on her own and came face to face with the one she wanted to fight most, Mondath. Mondath called in 11 guards that the rest of the party held off while Ori battled it out with her. The fight was tough but in the end Mondath knocked out Ori and Ash, who ran in to help. She was then finished off by Edison and Cormic who arrived after finally finishing off the guards. And that is where the sessions ended.

<p class="sessionrecap">
    The session starts up where we ended last time, with the party recovering from the battle with Mondath, many of them being severely damaged. After searching the room Mondath was in, the party found maps describing the Dragon Cults next plan of attack. Once everyone was healed, the party continued onward deeper into the dungeon, eventually coming across a trap door leading to a new area. After looking around for a bit they find a statue depicting Tiamat, the lord of dragons, with a chest sitting at the bottom. Attempting to open the chest triggered a trap, spraying acid gas from the walls that incapacitate Cormic and Edison, who were still damaged from the previous fight. Orianna, Brimless, and Ash carry their fallen allies to what they think is an escape as the gas follows them, but it ends up a dead end. A clutch investigation check from Orianna reveals another trap door, this time in the ceiling. After climbing through it, they barely have a moment to catch their breath before turning a corner to come face to face with Cyanwrath and three of his guards. Cyanwrath promises safety to everyone if he can finish his dual with Brimless uninterrupted. Brimless agrees with the terms that no weapons will be used. The fight begins, and Cyanwrath knocks Brimless to his feet with a lightning breath attack in an instant. Ori runs over to help an unconscious Brimless but is attacked by Cyanwrath for interrupting the fight, knocking her out, and triggering Cormic and Ash to go on the offensive. The fight begins, as Edison manages to wake up and each of the three are restrained by a guard while Cyanwrath forces them to watch him kill Brimless. But before he can, Brimless wakes back up and gets a good hit in while the Cormic, Ash, and Edison the guards. Eventually, Brimless is downed again and Ash manages to take the last hit on Cyanwrath, shooting a flaming crossbow bolt through his heart. After Cyanwrath is killed, the two remaining bodyguards reveal that they’re just mercenaries, doing any job to the highest bidder. They say that they have no alliance with the Dragon Cult and are willing team up with the party if they pay, which Cormic does. The party takes a rest and wakes up to continue their crawl into the dungeon to find the dragon eggs. Eventually as they walk one of the guards starts telling the party “hope you brought some fresh meat, otherwise Miguel’s not gonna be too happy”. They soon find out that Miguel is a particularly hungry ropper who happens to speak common. He politely demanded his fresh meat and after considering feeding him the bodyguards, they decide half of them will go retrieve Cyanwrath’s body while the others stay to make sure Miguel doesn’t get too mad. Ori, Brimless, and the bodyguards go to get the body while Cormic, Edison, and Ash stay behind. While Ori is gone, Cormic decides it would be a good idea to trick Miguel with a Minor Illusion spell. Unfortunately, that doesn’t go over too well for him and he looses his arm to Miguel who runs away right as Ori and Brimless get back, seeing Cormic bleeding out. And that’s we’re the session ended.

    <h1><bold>Mini-Session (Jarlaxle/Fenriic Origins)</bold></h1>
<p class="sessionrecap">
    We began by Jarlaxle being tasked by his Sensei to go to the nearby village Greenest in order to help deal with an Owlbear.  Fenriic, a mercenary, is given a job by his boss to go kill the same Owlbear.
    The two arrive at Greenest and are greeted by the mayor, who points them in the direction of the owlbear and informs them of their pay, 50gp.  While they are traveling, they encounter a group of 12 goblins led by Rolo, who know Fenriic from a past job and demand that he pay up.  Fenriic refuses, and after a loogie contest between Rolo and Jarlaxle, Fenriic shoots Rolo in the head.  The goblins then attack and almost kill the duo until Fenriic informs them of his job and promises to pay the goblins his reward in exchange for their help.  The goblins agree, and Yark, their navigator, uses a leaf to take them in the right direction.  As they enter a field, Jarlaxle and Yark find a badger, which Jarlaxle insists on keeping, despite it clawing and biting him.  Then, the Owlbear and two cubs enter the field.  The company sneaks over and attacks the Owlbear.  Fenriic misses his first shot while a hail of goblin arrow hit the Owlbear.  One misses, however, and hits the cub.  Jarlaxle decides to help it and runs over to it, attempting to pull the arrow out.  The momma Owlbear does not like this and proceeds to maul Jarlaxle, but he lives.  Jarlaxle runs away from the mom, taking the cub with him.  Fenriic shoots an arrow at the momma owlbear and hits.  Sharp, poisonous vines wrap around the Owlbear, with more arrows hitting it.  Jarlaxle manages to remove the arrow from the cub without hurting it.  The Owlbear moves to Jarlaxle, taking lethal damage from the thorns.  It collapses next to its cub and dies.  A sad Jarlaxle decides to raise the cub (the other one ran away).
    He and Fenriic decided to name the badger Oscar and the Owlbear cub Hoot.  Five goblins, along with Rolo and Yark, were killed.  Jarlaxle wandered off and was attacked by a pack of stirges.  He ran back to the rest of the group, where they proceeded to knock him unconscious and kill all ten remains goblins.  Fenriic was able to kill the stirges and save Jarlaxle, who was on two fails.  They then skinned the Owlbear and started back to Greenest.  However, when Greenest came into view, the heard a loud roar a crack of lightning.

<p class="sessionrecap">
    We open on Brimless, Ori and Ash running back to Greenest, trying to find backup. Out of session, they decided that the best course of action was to leave Cormic in the protection of Edison and the two mercenaries while the others went to get help in Greenest. Once they arrived at Greenest, they met up with Yltzvic (who may or may not had been committing arson while they were gone) and Brimless leaves to go to the bar while everyone else rushes to the Mayor for the backup. But instead of the troops they were expecting as backup, they come face to face with a hobgoblin and a child, around 8 years old. The Mayor informs them that these are the backups, and that it was on a bit of short notice so this was the best they could do. The Mayor also informed them that there’s also a doctor that will be joining them, but he’ll arrive in a few hours. After a little bit of interaction. The party learns a bit more about their new allies. The 8 year old is actually a shadow monk named Jarlaxle (no relation) who has a passion for collecting pets and the hobgoblin is an arcane archer mercenary named Fenriic. While they’re waiting in the town hall for the doctor to arrive, Ori spotted a man who just so happened to be holding a rare flower that she needs to cast an important spells, so she convinces Jarlaxle that the flower is dangerous and needs to be taken away from the man. After a little pestering, Jarlaxle and Ori learn that the man is actually the doctor they’ve been waiting on, and that the flower is a family heirloom. So they collect everyone into one spot and set off. So the team that goes back to the dungeon to save Cormic and Edison is Ori, Ash, Yltzvic, Fenriic, Jarlaxle, and the doctor whose name is Freud. Brimless stays at the bar. They make their way on the path to the dungeon and once they arrive, they go down a different path then they did before.
After barely dodging a few traps, they find a small group of kobolds that warship The Saviors, a group of hero’s who killed their captors (actually the party). The kobolds wouldn’t let the party go unless they joined their Commonwealth. The party eventually persuaded them to let them go, and they went on their way. Eventually, the party finally came across a room that looked familiar. It was the room right outside of Miguel’s lair, the room that had the acid trap on the walls. But taking a few steps farther in the room, the party found the mangled bodies of both Cormic and Edison. Most of the party was confused, as they didn’t know the two dead bodies. But Ori was shaken too her core, and without looking back to the party, she marched toward Miguel’s liar, ready to kill the bastard. She initiated the fight without hesitation, ready to die for her fallen friends, and the rest of the party joined quickly after. It was an incredibly difficult fight, where everyone ways grappled in the roppers tentacles, but Ori managed to get the finishing blow with her rapier. But the fight didn’t have its consequences, as Ori watched as the last of her good friends, Ash, died in her arms. The session ended with the party smashing the dragon eggs, and with Ori promising to bring Ash back.

    <h1><bold>7/31/20</bold></h1>
<p class="sessionrecap">
    This was a poggers session ngl. We start the session off with the party making their way slowly out of the dungeon, and with Ori giving her last goodbye to Cormic, while taking his spell book to remember him by. The moment the party exited the cave though, they were greeted with the sight of a massive floating airship descending closer to them with a halfling sorcerer and shield guardian that the players recognized as Gormon and Herald respectively. Gormon told them that all he wanted was Yltzvic, and wouldn’t hurt anyone else if he was just handed over politely. Ori decided to stand up for him, saying that she wouldn’t let him take her last friend away. So, Gormon decided he would just take Yltzvic by force, lifting him up to the ship with telekinesis. Ori quickly grabbed on to his legs and her plan set in motion. She casted invisibility and minor illusion at the same time to make it look like she was falling but actually stay holding on to his legs. Then, when Gormon placed them both on the ship, she shoved Gormon over the edge. Gormon quickly casted Featherfall on himself but that was just what Ori needed to make her way off the ship, jumping off and using Gormons slowly descending body to take most of the force of the fall, and accident leaving Yltzvic to save himself from Herald and Gormon, who was quickly flying back up to the ship. Yltzvic managed to set fire to the ship and while Gormon was distracted by an arrow from Fenriic, he jumped off the ship toward Ori who managed to catch him. Gormon shouted at them from the ship that they had one this time, but he would be back again to get all of them, and the group continued on toward town, with Ori carrying Ash’s body.
    Once the party finally arrived to town, they got a few simple chores done like. Yltzvic bought a new crossbow, Ori bought a new cloak, and attempted to pawn some of Cormic’s possessions. While on their way to meet the mayor, Ori, Jarlaxle and Yltzvic met a strange man with a sword who goes by Gabriel, that was knocking on random doors and trying to look for info on the Cult of Tiamat. He tells them that he wants to make sure Tiamat’s summoning is complete so he can slay Tiamat himself, and Ori agrees to talk to him more if he meets her in two hours at the local tavern, since she currently has other things to attend to. She and Jarlaxle and Yltzvic went to go meet with the Mayor and receive their next instructions. He told them that they should meet their old pal Leosin in a town called Elturel. There they can exchange information and what to do next in regards to stopping the cult. In the meantime, Ori casts Message to tell Frued and Fenriic to meet her at the local tavern. At the tavern, she asked Frued, Jarlaxle, and Fenriic if they would like to join the team since they had been through a lot together so far and they needed a few more people in the circus since 3 important figures were out of the picture. They agreed, but we’re all reluctant to have actual rolls in the circus. This is also when Ori realized that she would need to take the responsibility of organizing the circus and being the ringleader, a task that she isn’t sure she’s ready to fulfill.
    Around this time, Gabriel barged his way into the tavern and sat down for that meeting that he arranged with Ori. Ori introduced him to the rest of the group, and discussed a few things with him about the dragon cult. He told her that he wants to make sure that the cult succeeds in summoning Tiamat so that she could be slain, and that banishing her again is just delaying the inevitable. He said that he also believes that with the help of Ori’s group, it would be possible to slay Tiamat. Ori reluctantly agreed to allow him to join their traveling group, but knew that he was a suspicious figure that she shouldn’t completely trust. The rest of the night, the party drank away, a toast to completing their mission, and to the friends they’d lost. While Jarlaxle, Frued, and Gabriel stayed sober, Ori, Fenriic and Yltzvic became pretty drunk, and the party was introduced to the emotional mess that is drunk Ori. She rambled about how she wasn’t ready to have to be the new face of the circus now that everyone else who was a major player in it is gone, about how she blames herself for the death of Cormic, Edison, and Ash, and about how she was the one who planted false ideas in Jarlaxle’s mind about Frued’s flower, and how she just wanted it to cast a spell that reminded her of her mother. The next day, everyone woke up strewn across the tavern or in hotel rooms, and the ones who drank payed the massive bill for last night. Ori introduced everyone to the Caravan she calls home, and officially enters them as true members of the Fate’s Fools. And together, Orianna, Jarlaxle, Fenriic, Gabriel, Yltzvic, and Frued all set off to confront the wonders that await them on the road.

    <h1><bold>Mini Session 2 (Jarlaxle)</bold></h1>
<p class="sessionrecap">
    Was travelling with young child (Jarlaxle) when he suddenly collapsed without warning. He was immediately rushed into the caravan and laid down, with no obvious wounds. The child seemed to have steady functions, and upon further examinations the body was determined to have no punctures whatsoever. After roughly 2 hours, the child awoke in a cold sweat. Upon waking up, he screamed about dragons, akin to someone waking up from a bad dream. He seemed to think that all of our travelling companions had been killed by a dragon. Upon further interrogation, the child claimed to have searched the woods for his pet badger (which, to the extent of my knowledge, never left the caravan - damned thing!) when he encountered a strange man wielding a magical staff and wearing a metal mask, similar to one a blacksmith would wear. The man knocked his friend Orianna (last name unknown), who also never left the caravan, unconscious, then struck his staff on the ground and blacked the subject unconscious. When the subject "woke up" from this unconsciousness, the subject claimed to see his future - a white dragon freezing all us chaps to death. The next thing he saw, he was with us. Next to him laid a staff that he said was in his fever dream, so immediately grabbed it which rapidly tensed up his muscles, which seemed to cause him to reverse his course and claim it was a nonmagical staff.

    Hypothesis:
    Child is likely severely brain damaged/traumatized, causing him to hallucinate and reform these now-unlocked memories of his past. The threat of this dragon cult we are now fighting combined with the trauma of having to leave his family could likely cause him to hallucinate things that reflect his trauma, such as his makeshift "family" of the caravan all dying a grisly death. Subject should likely seek further help in the form of psychoanalysis/intensive therapy. Will inform the viewer further upon further analysis

<p class="sessionrecap">
    Anyways the session starts with the party still on the road in the caravan, it had been about 2-3 days since we left Greenest. It was around mid-day when the party arrived to Beregost, their next rest stop, and a place where Freud said he had business to attend to. It was a pretty large town, comparatively to Greenest, yet it was strangely empty, with only the occasional commoner passing by, many of the houses looking empty. Freud immediately hopped out of the caravan when they arrived and went off around the town, clearly looking for something or someone. Ori and Jarlaxle decided to follow him, asking Gabriel to keep watch of the caravan or look for a place to stay for the night. After asking Freud what he was doing, they found out that he was looking for the towns Mayor for private, personal reasons, but everyone in the town told him that they’ve never had a Mayor, which Freud was sure was false. They decided to make their way to the large mansion over the town, on a hill, which all the town folks also said no one ever lived in. Meanwhile, back with Gabriel and Brimless at the caravan, (Yltzvic had decided to wander town and Fenriic was mysterious absent, on his own job) a halfling man approached, offering rooms at his tavern for the travelers. They both accepted, and followed him there to meet his wife, also a halfling, and purchase a few rooms. The owner started drawing Gabriel and Brimless, and asked for physical descriptions of the others.
    Back to Ori, Jarlaxle, and Freud. Upon arrival the the mansion in the hill, they realized it seemed as thought no one had lived here for months, however the claim that no one ever lived there could not be true, as it was still mostly well taken care of. After Freud busted down the gate, Ori tried to open up the locked door as Jarlaxle took Freud aside and tried to get out of him what he came here for. Freud reluctantly told him that in this town, his mother was killed because she was suspected to be a witch. And Freud wanted to get payback. From inspecting the door, and the outside of the house, Ori decided that it would be best if the whole party was here for this. So she ran to retrieve them and found Yltzvic, Brimless, and Gabriel at the tavern. The tavern owner drew Ori’s face as well, and when Ori questioned him on it he said it was “just so he can remember”. She brushed it off and dragged the others over to mansion, where she saw Jarlaxle and Freud, scratched and scarred in places they weren’t before she left. When she asked what happened, they told her that they don’t remember and that they probably just tripped or something. Once Brimless knocked down the door the party entered and found a few suspicious things. For one, there was a family portrait hanging upstairs which showed a mother, father, and son. There were 2 beds in the children’s room, despite the portrait only showing one child. The main thing that felt off was that when Ori and Gabriel walked past the large window upstairs, they felt watched, like something was peering at them. They both tried certain abilities to detect for any magical presence, both of which came up short. The party soon after left the mansion with no leads on what happened to them, but they all collectively agreed that something was very off. It was getting late however, so the most of the party decided they would continue their investigation tomorrow morning
    Ori however, still had some personal business to attend to in this town, and Gabriel decided to accompany her. Ori wanted to take Ash’s body to the towns cleric, to get his body blessed and stop it from decaying so that she could bring him back in tip-top condition. On their way, Gabriel asked Ori if this town made her feel... weird too, being the only other magic user. She agreed with him that there’s something off, but she can’t put her finger on it and that she wants to leave next morning. They arrived at the temple, and left ash’s body to to be blessed over night, although the temple was strange too. The two of them made their way back to the tavern, and Gabriel revealed to Ori that he wasn’t on great terms with his own god, Savras. That night, Ori slept in the only room that had one bed, without anyone else. She had an awful... “dream”. In her room we’re blood splatters, all over the floor in the middle of the room, leading out of the slightly opened door like something was dragged out. Ori cautiously climbed out of peered our the door into the hallway where she saw an awful, fleshy abomination with three long necks and ghastly, elongated human-like heads on each neck, all of its teeth covered in blood. The of the heads was tearing into a dead female gnome on the floor, that the blood path followed up to. One of the heads reached out to bite her but she woke up in a cold sweat before it hit her, still in her bed with a bruise in her head and traces of blood around her room. The moment she woke up from the dream she ran into the hallway (where a gross monster and pile of blood wasn’t) and checked on everyone, making sure they’re ok. When everyone asked what was wrong, she realized she... wasn’t sure. She knew she had a dream, but it was fading away quickly, leaving her with nothing but a sense of dread. She apologized to everyone for waking them and walked downstairs to the actual bar part for breakfast and a hardy tankard of ale to think over.
    When the owner came out from the kitchen, to serve her, she noticed his wife wasn’t there and asked him here she went. He was very confused at this question, claiming he never had a wife. And Ori quickly realized that this was true. He never did have a wife. Must have just been another dream she had last night. Everyone else came downstairs quickly and the party ate a nice breakfast together, starting a conversation with the owner. During the conversation, he pulled out his lunch menu and showed them that the local kids must have been messing with him because the menu said “help me it is watching me right now” in messy ink on it. Apparently, stuff like this happened all the time because the owner seemed fairly unfazed by the disturbing message. Before the party could question it more, they heard a scream coming from a woman outside and they all instinctively ran out to help. By the time they got to her, she was not longer screaming and was just standing back up and dusting himself off. When the party asked her if she was ok she claimed that she was fine, she just got startled by something. She didn’t remember what though. She described it like waking up from a dream and knowing something awful happened, but not being able to remember what. Ori immediately knew the feeling she was talking about and decided something was really really wrong in this town. She asked the woman to to lead her on the oath she just walked. She showed them that she was waking through an ally way when she got startled, but nothing else really stuck out to the party as odd. They did, however, meet a strange man while they were walking with the woman. He was clearly insane, screaming rambles about a thing, a monster in the streets that was taking people and no one was noticing. The party questioned him more, and he described to them what he’s seen.
    He told them that it’s a multi-headed creature that slinks in the shadows and strikes when one is alone, singing it’s magical song and causing people not to see it. When asked how he could see it, he took of his hood and showed that the had cut off his ears, damaging them enough to stop him from hearing the song. With that information, the party set up a plan to find this thing, if it exists at all, and free the town of it. And thaaaaaaaats where the session ended. I probably forgot stuff in there sorry will

    <h1><bold>8/8/20</bold></h1>
<p class="sessionrecap">
    the session started where the last one ended with the party discussing what to do next. Midway through their conversation, they felt a deafening silence (I forgot to mention this in the last one but there’s a deafening silence whenever the creature takes another victim) which they ignored, not knowing that Brimless had just been taken by the false hydra. The rest of the party decided that the best course of action was to find the towns largest building and look for something in the streets from above. The tallest building just so happened to be the same temple that Ori got Ash’s body blessed at the night before, so they went to give it a try. Turns out, the highest spot was their bell, and only high ranking monks are allowed up there. Jarlaxle managed to convince them that he’s a monk of Lathander, and he was allowed access while everyone else had to stay back. On his way to the highest point, Jarlaxle found a basket of beautiful, crisp golden apples and couldn’t resist the temptation of taking a bite. The apples turned out to be holy in nature, blessed by Lathander, and they blinded him with their radiant light, causing him to stumble down the stairs right at the feet of the high priest himself, who’s meditation was disturbed by Jarlaxles bumbling. The high priest tried to grab him and struggled to pin him down causing a small fight between the two causing the rest of the party to check behind the curtains to the high priests meditation room to see what was going on. The high priest explained to them that Jarlaxle had eaten one of the sacred apples and was in a reserved part of the temple. Ori grabbed Jarlaxle our of his arms and tried to brush it of by saying he was her son and that they were just on her way out but as she was walking away the high priest made a remark about her infernal blood. In retaliation, Ori casted a spell against the priest as a warning strike to scare him and accidentally killed him.
    This turned the next hour and a half into a spiral of blame, excuses, and lies as the party stumbled on what to do next. Ori casted Invisibility and started to book it, advising the others to do the same. Right after she did that, a lesser monk entered the meditation room and saw the dead priest. Before the party could talk to him, convince him to leave, or run, Yltzvic stabbed him dead in one strike and fled the room. The other three weren’t so lucky, as they got arrested quickly. Luckily, after some good persuasion checks, bad insight checks, and a little help from Ori, the temple collectively decided that the stabbed monk had eaten one of the apples and his stomach exploded and that the priest died of a heart attack after seeing that. Jarlaxle mentioned that he ate an apple, and asked if his stomach would explode too and one of the monks told him it would and that he didn’t have much time left. The party decided to group up with Freud, who stayed with the screaming woman from last session, and begin figuring out another plan. While they were meeting up with each other, another deafening silence was felt by the whole party as the memory of Hoot started to fade away into nothing. They asked Freud if he could see what was wrong with Jarlaxle, but he told them that he doesn’t specialize in magic and all he can suggest is a good amount of rest. So, much to some of the groups dismay, they decided to call it a day and rest up back at the inn. While some of the party (Ori, Fenriic, and Yltzvic) decided to stay up a bit, Jarlaxle, Freud, and Gabriel went to bed early. While Jarlaxle was sleeping (in the same room as Freud), Freud loomed over him with a pillow and tried to suffocate him. With a bit of struggle, Jarlaxle knocked Freud out and ran out into the tavern for help. The party decided that it wasn’t safe for Jarlaxle to sleep alone with Freud, so they changed up their room partners.
    Jarlaxle and Ori would sleep in a room, Fenriic and Yltzvic would sleep in a room, and Freud and Gabriel would sleep in a room (at this point everyone who was staying up went to bed). While Jarlaxle was settling down into his new room, the one Ori was sleeping alone in last night, he found something strange. An adventurers pack next to the empty bed, and other items that seem to belong to and explorer. When the two went through the bag more they realized it belonged to a female gnome, a cleric most likely, who according to diaries and notes used to travel in their circus. Her diary describes her Friends Jarlaxle, Ori, Yltzvic, Fenriic, Freud and Gabriel in vivid detail, and someone named Brimless. She claimed to have traveled with them, been with them for a very long time and even consider them a family. It describes them arriving at Greenest, surviving a dragon attack, raiding a dragon cult base and loosing her friends Cormic, Edison, and Ash. It describes her arriving at a strange town with an empty mansion called Beregost. But as the notes went on from there, they got more and more deranged, rambling about a monster, repeating the same phrase. “Don’t listen to its song”. Out of character, we all realized this was the gnome from Ori’s “dream” and that she had always known us but died from the False Hydra and caused us to forget. At this point Ori was the only one still reading. It was around the middle of the night and everyone else was asleep but Ori was staying up, trying to find info on this person. She had taken pieces of fabric and turned them into makeshift ear plugs to block out this so called “song”. A little later into the night, Ori saw something. A three-headed creature peering at her from her open window, slinking it’s way inside, before realizing Ori could see it and fleeing. But needless to say, this time Ori remembered. The session ended with Ori standing defensively in front of Jarlaxle and feeling another deafening silence

    <h1><bold>8/11/20</bold></h1>
<p class="sessionrecap">
    Shoutout to the homies who actually showed up to this one you’re the real bros. The session started where the last one left off, with Ori staring down a singular head of the beast that had been haunting the group ever since they arrived in Beregost. It had made its way to the other side of the street when it realized Ori could see it and started watching, sitting unflinchingly for hours. Eventually, she woke up Jarlaxle and told him to get the others (just Freud and Gabriel). All three of them were given ear plugs and Ori explained to them how the past few hours he had been staring, and that this must have been the creature they learned about in the abandoned library. She also explained to them that the way she figured out that they needed ear plugs was from Kippers notes (poor Kipper). They eventually decided to suit up and go outside to finally confront this thing, but we’re a little reluctant on bringing Jarlaxle as he seemed pretty scared. They eventually traced it back to an open sewer grate and climbed inside the sewers to follow it back to its layer. After hours of trudging through sludge and waste (and Seth shipping Ori and Gabriel) they finally arrived at something. It was a pile of what seemed to be human and animal remains, and something was shuffling around under it. After a little suspense, it was revealed to be Hoot who somehow barely survived the False Hydra. Before the group could get aquatinted with the return of their animal friend, the False Hydra quickly attacked. The fight was tough, as it’s necks quickly coiled around the party an the head bit into their flesh. Ori’s many attempts to charm or curse the creature were foiled by its surprisingly high mental skills. Eventually, a powerful divine smite from Gabriel sliced its heads off but not before Freud unfortunately was taken out. When Gabriel tried to heal him, his body was unresponsive to the magic and felt cold. And that’s where the session ended.

    Very role play heavy session, it was pretty much just role play not a single combat encounter and every few skill checks. So idk how that will translate into this recap. Anyways, the session picked up where the last one left off with the party having just killed the False Hydra and with Freud being unresponsive. After a little more magical healing Ori recognized he was in a state of shock, having been in his first fight ever and almost dying, but he was still alive. They took him and Hoot back to the caravan where everyone fell asleep, exhausted from the fight, ready to depart the next day. In the morning the party got hit the road to Elturel, which was the city they were told to meet Leosin at by the Governor in Greenest what seemed like ages ago. The destination was only about two days away so the party got to interact and grow closer a lot on the way without being interrupted by dead gods and unholy monsters. Early on in the trip, Ori realized that once they arrived at Elturel they would have to preform, and it would not only be Ori’s first time as the ringleader but also her first time working with a whole new team with no established routine. Needless to say, she was a little stressed. She worked with Jarlaxle, Gabriel, and Hoot on what their roles would be. Gabriel would read fortunes, drawing from his divine power as an Aasimar of Savras, god of fate. Jarlaxle would use his dancing lights and acrobatics, and would also work with Hoot to have him do little tricks like jump through hoops. Ori was pretty happy with this, but knew it needed a lot more work and structure, as well as just something more.
While they were working things out Ori decided to show off a new trick she hadn’t used yet. She casted Speak With Animals and talked to Hoot, how had a more polite tone then expected but was still very much an owlbear, always focused on his next meal. She spoke to him about the circus and asked if he would be ok with being in it, and he said that he would as long as he got plenty of extra food. She also asked about what he thought of Jarlaxle, to which Hoot replied with “he’s a nice boy, I would prefer if he was less controlling though”. She also tried talking to Oscar and the horses, to no avail. Eventually, after two days of travel, they arrived at the gates of Elturel which was being guarded by boarder security, which was pretty much just one man. He questioned them about the nature of their visit and about the... owlbear cub in their caravan. He told them that there was no way he could allow Hoot into the city without proof of regeneration. Ori defused the conflict with some magical seduction (charm person) and they carried on into the city with a few thing in their mind. Finding Leosin, finding a place to sleep, finding where to preform, and finding out what the deal was with the massive floating orb in the sky. They knocked out two of those at once when Freud recommended his favorite local tavern, A Pair Of Black Antlers, and introduced the party to the bartender who was his good friend. He gave the party free rooms and informed them a little about the city, telling them that the orb in the sky was conjured by a powerful cleric in the city to ward off undead.
Anyways, Freud is actually a local to Elturel and he told the party about a doctors club that he was part of, just a group of doctors in the city that meet up under this very tavern every now and then and pretty soon would be one of their meetings. He asked Jarlaxle if he could take Hoot to the meeting and show Hoot to his doctor friends and do some “medicinal tests” on him, which Jarlaxle was nervous about but reluctantly agreed to as long as Hoot wasn’t hurt. It was made even more suspicious by the fact that the club met in a secret room under a trap door that they weren’t allowed into. The took Hoot down there for the meeting later and the party left to go look for Leosin and a place to preform. On their way they found the local church and asked them what they knew if Jarlaxle’s glowing. The nun said that it was an awful curse of Lathander that will cause him to glow brighter and brighter until he’s nothing but light, but had not intel on how to get rid of it. Eventually while looking through Cormic’s notes, she realized she place to go to for the show was the High Hall where they met the man who crated the magical sphere. He’s a bit of a local celebrity, not even a local celebrity he’s a hero, but his magical power was mostly drained by creating the orb, also known as the Companion. He told the party that they would be preforming at the High Hall and that he would be amongst the audience. After dealing with that, the party went back to APOBA to meet and Leosin and his friend, who’s name I forget rn but he IS important, in order to discuss plans for the future in regards to dealing with the dragon cult. It turns out Leosins friend was quite a partier and refused to talk until the party showed him how to have a good time. He quickly took a likening to Ori and also grew quite fond with Jarlaxle and Gabriel. And so, the party drank the night away with their new friend, pretty much forgetting about the plans they met up to make.
And that’s where the session ended.

    <h1><bold>8/22/20</bold></h1>
<p class="sessionrecap">
    Today the party finally embraces their inner fucking clown. The session started where it left off with everyone drinking and tired and with Jarlaxle locked in the basement. In the middle of the night Ori realized that she hadn’t seen Jarlaxle and went into a panic trying to find him. Eventually he managed to get out when the doctor club or whatever it’s called went to let him out (Fenriic showed back up too). In the morning, the party planned for their first performance as a new team. Ori was stressed out of her mind about it because not only was it her first time as ringleader but it was her first time working with this group and it was a performance for high ranking nobles. They decided that Fenriic would show off his archery, then shoot an arrow at Thavious Kreeg, the most influential noble in the stands, and Jarlaxle would catch it in midair. Jarlaxle then would go on to show off his acrobatic skills. Then, for the grand finale, Gabriel and Hoot would have an epic (fake) battle. It was difficult to convince Hoot to do it, and to not just kill Gabriel, but after promising as much food as he wanted he complied. Jarlaxle also insisted on a petting zoo for Oscar (pretty sure he was the imposter trying to sabotage us ngl). The show went on as a great success to the relief of Ori and the rest of the party, and they made a good about of gold from it too, dedicating some of it to food for Hoot.
    The party then went to go find Leosin’s friend (I’m sorry will I forgot his name again I’ll start writing them down during the session) because they remembered that they never got the info they needed, while Jarlaxle went to go buy some goats and dogs with his money. They were told to go to Baldur’s Gate next, as a group of Dragon Cultists are traveling in disguise among normal people on their way there. They were also told that they might need to rebrand for a bit, change their names and outfits so they aren’t noticed while traveling. So, they got on their way, boarding a boat that would go along the river toward Baldur’s Gate, and Ori made quick friends with the wood elf captain. Everyone settled down, counted their earnings, and relaxed after finally having a good win for once as their ship slowly drifted toward their next adventure. And that’s where the session ended.
    
</p>
<br>
    <h1><bold>8/29/20</bold></h1>
<p class="sessionrecap">
    Anyways, the session starts where the last one left off, with the crew relaxing on a boat on their way to Baldur’s Gate (accompanied by Yltzvic this time). Everyone was off doing their own thing until they all heard a loud roar coming from the storage area below. They ran toward it as quickly as they could to find Jarlaxle being attacked by a hungry Hoot who was angry over Jarlaxle taking away the remaining goats he was trying to eat. The party tried to hold him back and pretty much entirely failed until Freud of all people came in clutch by throwing a strange looking metal orb at Hoot, causing Hoot to instantly disappear. He explained that it was a magical item he had been working on while he was studying Hoot in Elturel and that it manipulates the primal ki inside of all animals to send them to a dormant demiplane inside the orb. Essentially, a Pokéball that he gave to Jarlaxle as thanks for letting him research Hoot for him to keep Hoot inside of when they’re in busy towns or places where an owlbear wouldn’t exactly be expectable. For the rest of the boat ride everyone relaxed, knowing that once they arrived at their destination they would have some investigation to do.
    After about a day more of travel they finally arrived at Baldur’s Gate, the largest city in the Sword Coast. While it definitely isn’t as well kept as Elturel, Baldur’s Gate was definitely an intimidating place to look for the Dragon Cult due to its sheer size. After a while of searching Ori eventually noticed a group of what seemed to be simple traders that she definitely recognized from her first visit to the camp. She was about to confront them but she realized that as the only person in the group that had attacked the camp in the past, she would need a disguise as not to be recognized. With a nice tux, some makeup, and a top hat, she pulled off a pretty posh elf. She and Gabriel confronted the suspected cultists as they were loading containers of food from one cart to another. Orianna managed to convince them that she was Baldur’s Gate’s top detective and that Gabriel was her powerful bodyguard, and there here was an investigation happening in town. After a bit of questioning, she confirmed that they’re on their way to Waterdeep but they never admitted that they were Dragon Cultists.
    After returning back to the rest of the group Fenriic mentioned another detail that Gabe and Ori failed to notice, a more expensive, luxury looking carriage. Fenriic had noticed that there seemed to be either a black-scaled Half Dragon within. So Ori and Gabriel, being the charisma tanks they are, went back to the cultist (who the party were now assuming we’re guards) and intimidated them into letting them speak to the Half Dragon, although they seemed very unhappy to do so saying “she really won’t be pleased with this”. Apon stepping into the carriage they came face to face with Rezmir, one of the five leaders of the Dragon Cult. After a while of back and forth and interrogation, Ori told her that she knew who she was, causing Rezmir to initiate her escape. One of her associates, who Ori recognized as Rath Modar, a red  wizard, helped her teleport away. Gabe and Ori both ran out of the carriage only to be confronted by the rest of the cultists ready to attack with pikes, telling them that “they should keep this between you and me”. Ori almost started a fight, but realized for once that their numbers were too large in too highly populated of an area for a conflict to break out, so they walked away back to the rest of the party catching them up on what they missed. With nothing else to do other then keep moving, following the group of cultists who are now without their leader, the party departed on their way to Waterdeep.
    Ok this part is gonna be kinda weird for me because it’s just me writing about my own arc but please humor me, pretend it’s someone else writing this.
    After about a week on the road, the party approached their next pit stop. Orianna knew this destination was coming but pushed it out of her mind, trying not to think about it, all until now. A seemingly bright town, mostly populated by tieflings, named Brimstone. Ori’s hometown. She hadn’t told anyone that she was from here however (although Cormic obviously knew and I feel like Edison would have known, and she spoke to Freud before arriving in a way where he could assume this was her hometown). They were greeted by a sort of welcoming committee who told them about the festival that the party would be performing at. Immediately after arriving Ori left the party for a little to visit her old home, which she assumed would be torn down or given to a new family. Instead, it was barred and chained up, almost as if under high security. She decided that she would come back after the performance tomorrow morning and joined her friends. They were all settling down in the local inn and getting ready to finally sleep in a normal bed for the first time in a while (the room arrangement was Jarlaxle and Freud, Fenriic and Yltzvic, and Gabriel and Ori) when Ori heard a knock at the door. She cracked the door open and saw the familiar face of the town’s mayor. They had a high-tension little conversation, catching up a bit, with Ori making it clear that she still hadn’t fully forgiven him for what he’d done to her family. Before he left she asked him about the house and about why it’s all locked up. He told her that “we found a new use for it” before going to the rest of the rooms to introduce himself to the rest of the party.
    The next morning the party performed at the festival, mostly acing the show, although Ori was a little more distracted then usual. After the show was over, the mayor presented himself before the crowd saying that there was one more show for the day. He said that a criminal had tried to escape the prison the night before, and that the said prisoner would be used as an example with a public execution. And dragged up to the podium to be killed was none other then Nawala Roza, Ori’s mother. In pure rage Ori managed to crash her way on to the stage and shove the executioner aside, while freeing her mother. The session ended with the Mayer in pure anime fashion saying “...you truly are just like your mother”.
    
</p>
<br>
    <h1><bold>9/4/20</bold></h1>
<p class="sessionrecap">
    The session started where the last one left off, with Orianna standing on the execution stage clutching her mother, while confronting Mavathos, the man who took her family away. The other party members are standing in another stage in the other side of a massive confused crowd that was going to watch the execution. After a little back and forth between the two, Orianna had enough and casted Dissonant Whispers in him while he fought back with strange, ethereal daggers accompanied by the executioner himself who attacked with an axe. Fenriic and Gabriel took this as their cue to just into the fray to diffuse the conflict, as town guards started flooding in to detain Ori and her mother, while Freud ushered Jarlaxle away from the conflict. Ori casted invisibility on her mother while blocking attacks, and told her run, and then properly surrendered herself while telling her allies to surrender or run. They however weren’t ready to comply, as Fenriic kills one of the town guards and Gabriel struggles but both are eventually detained.
    In prison, they’re given some exposition from Ori and Mavathos, telling them that Ori’s parents were arrested by Mavathos for their usage of magic, which is illegal in this town. However, after a little questioning, Ori learned the truth behind the conditions of her parent’s arrest. They had been studying the Feywild, and eventually discovered a powerful creature, a god, trapped there. Eventually, they managed to cross over to the Feywild where they met the god, known as The Traveler. He gave them an offer. They would free him and be his servants in exchange for magical power. So, they tricked him, accepting the deal where he returned the the material plane... straight into a powerful magic circle where he remains trapped to this day. As you could expect, a powerful god being trapped under a town had a massive effect in magic. Now every spell cast in Brimstone draws some chaotic energy from The Traveler, giving it the Wild Magic effect, and making it extremely dangerous and risky to cast spells. When Ori asked about why they hadn’t just released The Traveler to get rid of its effect, he said that it was trapped there with a puzzle no one could solve, and that he himself was using some of The Travelers powers, like the ethereal daggers, to manipulate the town. Right before Mavathos left the prison, after telling them that they would be executed soon, Ori asked where her father is. He told her that he was a little more resistant in the arrest, and that he had to be made an example of.
    Then right after he left, none other then Jarlaxle and Freud showed up. They used Hoot to break the rest of the party out, who all ran straight to Ori’s old home to solve the puzzle, release The Traveler, and expose Mavathos. When they arrived, it was eerie. Everything was just as Ori had left it before she ran away, but it had still changed. A blanket of dust and cobwebs covered everything. The stairway down to the basement had a strange, drawing aura to it. Once everyone went in, they were greeted to a strange elven man in a green cloak who was trapped in some sort of binding circle, with a weird ven-diagram surrounding it. The puzzle proved easy for the creatively thinking party and as they completed it, the circle burst open with blinding light as the strange man and Ori disappeared. The session ended with Ori opening her eyes to place she’d only seen in her dreams: The Feywild, and with Mavathos walking down the basement stairs toward the party, uttering “...so you’ve done it”.
</p>
<br>
    <h1><bold>9/7/20 (Mini Session?)</bold></h1>
<p class="sessionrecap">
    Mini session and the return of something called combat? Idk bro pretty wacky. The session started where the last one left off with Ori being teleported to the feywild and the rest of the fates fools being left behind to deal with Mavathos. Mavathos did his villain monologue about how they were ruining his plans by freeing the Traveler and that he would have to kill them right here, right now, as he summoned his shadowy hound companion and prepared for battle. Meanwhile Orianna materializes in the Fey to be confronted with the Traveler himself tap-dancing gleefully on a great stage. After approaching him and asking him where her friends are, he showed her a vision of her friends about to get into a fight with Mavathos. Ori immediately demanded that he send her back to them, knowing how dangerous Mavathos is, but the Traveler refused as he needed a sort of a deal with Ori first. The Traveler still needs her in some way (which wasn’t explained yet) and he decided you give an offer. She would give her soul up to him and spread the word of him, in exchange for returning to the material plane and being given strength, magical power, to finally deal with Mavathos. At first she was reluctant, knowing that if the Traveler needed this deal, she could bend it to her will a little bit and she tried to negotiate. But after seeing another vision of her friends being barraged by ethereal daggers and the evil hound, with Jarlaxle taking the lead in the fight, she realized that she didn’t really have the liberty for deals right now and made the Traveler promise that she would except the deal, but with one exception. Any fuckery done by the Traveler would be done upon her, and her friends would be left out of it. So, they shook hands and the deal was done. So, she began the teleportation back to the material plane and the Traveler gave her a “taste of what’s to come” by sort of taking the back seat in her soul, and giving her a heightened portion of her new warlock powers.
    When she arrived back to the material plane, the party wasn’t looking too good. Gabriel was knocked unconscious while Freud and Fenriic tried their hardest to deal with Mavathos as Jarlaxle finally destroyed the hound with his magical staff. When Mavathos noticed her return, he could see the rage in her eyes as she finished him off with a wave of daggers similar to his own, finally knocking him unconscious. And that's where the session ended.
</p>
<br>
    <h1><bold>9/12/20</bold></h1>
<p class="sessionrecap">
    Quicker session, just tying up some loose ends. We start in the basement where Mavathos was defeated, and after a while of debate about what to do with him, the party decided to show mercy to him, dressing him up in a clown costume and leaving his unconscious body with a note, telling him that he had been stripped of his power and was lucky that Orianna didn’t kill him where he stood. While they were deciding this, Jarlaxle looked around the house and found a magical wand that created flowers. Ori also learned that the business card she was given had some magic properties, as after reading, Jarlaxle was charmed by her. After that, the rest of the party started to get ready to hit the road again while Ori looked for her mother. She knew that her neighbors across the road were good friends with her family, so she assumed that her mother might be hiding out there, and she was right. After confirming she was really who she said she was to the neighbors, they let her in where her mother was hiding, safe. They talked for a little bit and caught up with each other, and Ori told her that she was traveling with some good people and that they could take her to a safe place in Waterdeep. She introduced her mother to the group and they got on the road toward Waterdeep.
    On their way, they were attacked by a T. Rex out of nowhere. The party seemed like they were going to lose this fight, not ready for combat, but Gabriel came in clutch with a crit on an upcasted inflict wounds, striking it in the heart and killing it outright. Although when it fell, it crushed their caravan, and the session ended with the party piecing together the remains of the caravan and healing each other
</p>
<br>
    <h1><bold>9/18/20</bold></h1>
<p class="sessionrecap">
    pooky ghost session. Gabriel die but it ok he get better. The last session ended with the party’s caravan getting crushed by corpse of a T. Rex. So this session started with the party discussing what they should do next. They knew that they were in the middle of nowhere, with no towns in walking distance for a good while, and it was starting to get late. So they all decided to set up camp for the night. Orianna, Fenriic, and Gabriel decided to take shifts of watch. On Gabriel’s shift, he noticed three ghostly glowing orbs floating towards him. They spoke to him, telling him that they could help him get back on the road if he followed them, but his friends couldn’t come with them. So he followed them, far, far away from his friends toward the edge of a lake... when Gabriel looked into the lake she saw the reflection of four dead bodies of various races, one of which a Fallen Aasimar like Gabriel. The spirits started to speak to Gabe, telling him “this is where we died... fell into the lake... it was an unjust death, it wasn’t our time... and now you will be joining us and our master” as the decaying, acrid corpse of the Aasimar rose from the lake, floating, seeming fueled by some furious necrotic energy. It attacked him, along with the spirits that guided him there.
    The fight was instantly difficult, with the spirits draining his life force and the zombie-like Aasimar shrieking angrily and slashing with its claws. Through certain loose pieces of dialogue said by the Aasimar and spirits during the fight, Gabe was able to put together that the spirits serve the Aasimar ghoul, and they led him back here for the Aasimar to reap him and for his soul to join them. Eventually, the party heard the ruckus and the booming noise of divine smites coming from Gabriel’s attacks, and Ori, Freud, and Fenriic ran to go help, with Jarlaxle a little behind. When they finally arrived they saw Gabriel and the spirits. Right when they arrived, they saw that Gabriel wasn’t doing great. He was staggering. He fought masterfully had slayed the Aasimar by the time his friends arrived, but the spirits were now becoming even more aggressive and Gabriel was drained from the fight with the creature, and pretty quickly after the Aasimar was slain, he finally was knocked down. The rest of the party started attacking the ghosts but their attacks barely landed, passing through them. And eventually, Gabriel couldn’t hold on any more, as his soul lingered away. He woke up surrounded by light. But not a calming, soothing light like a heavenly glow, but a wavy purple light like he was on the inside of a fire. He heard many voices around him, and one talked straight to him specifically, welcoming him in an almost sinister way. It told him that he had now joined them, like they sought out for. When Gabe asked what was going on, the spirit told him this:
    “We were once a party of adventures you see, much like you and your merry band of friends. We were the ones you saw in the lake. And that Aasimar fellow, oh he was much like you. Determined. Likable. arrogant. We were tired of him, so we killed him and through him in the lake. But, alas, he got his revenge, kept our souls trapped here with him. But one day, if we collect enough souls to be part of us, we will be free!”
    “What do I do! How do I get out of here! I need to leave now!!”
    “Sorry, you’re trapped here now like the rest of us. Although, there may be another way...”
    “Yes..?”
    “You have a strong soul don’t you. What if we, say, come along with you. You will take us with you, we will bring our pursuit to the outside world. No longer will we need to lure people here.”
    “Are you saying you want control of my body? For me to be your puppet?!”
    “Oh no no, we will not interfere with you. You just need to bring us souls. We have a quota to hit to return to our bodies, you know”
    “No! I won’t help you! You people are evil, you killed your friend and you deserve to be trapped here with him. I just wanted to put him to rest!”
    “Ah, but don’t you have a mission to complete? To kill Tiamat? How will you do that from here, you’re just another one of us. Don’t you want to honor your oath?”
    “Fine. I’ll do it. But I WILL find a way to get rid of you. You won’t be with me for long”
    “...we’ll see...”
    And with that, the countless souls all as one conglomerate enter his body, taking a sort of backseat in his own soul. He wakes up, alive as ever, with his friends leaning over him making sure he’s ok. He tells them he’s fine, and that he should start fixing up the caravan as he needs a moment to himself at the lake. After they leave, he sits by the lake, and speaks toward where the Aasimar was and starts a prayer toward his God. The spirit of the Aasimar responded back saying “not many are as kind as you my friend. Farewell.” And he received inspiration (along with the Hallowed One feat for being revived from the dead in a way other then a spell). After that he went back to his friends, helped them repair the rest of the caravan, and they hit the road toward Waterdeep. Gabriel now has a new challenge to overcome, but he’s gonna have to just roll with it
</p>

    <h1><bold>9/25/20</bold></h1>
    <p class="sessionrecap">
        God. sniff I almost cried. The session started with the party finally arriving at their destination, Waterdeep. The first thing they do upon arrival is visit the world-famous tavern known as the Yawning Portal. Once they get there they realize that the tavern is a little more lively then they expected, seeming like the medieval version of a rave. The bouncer outside is easily shrugged off with Ori’s new Magic Fake I.D. and once they get inside it’s even MORE lively then they thought. Ori tells Jarlaxle to pass off as a halfling if possible. There are people dancing and yelling and cheering everywhere and above the Portal itself is some magical smoke, showing the shape of a bearded wizard fighting a group of 6 heros, and eventually being dragged into the ground by ethereal chains. Upon seeing that, the tavern roared with cheers as a short halfling and an arcane golem emerge from the smoke. Gorman and Herald in the flesh. Yltzvic immediately hides, but the rest of the party doesn’t, and Gormon takes no notice of them. He seems to be pretty well received by the crowd, no one is booing him like they would have if it was Halaster. So, Jarlaxle goes to sit down next to him and talk. Gormon takes a major liking to him, assuming he is also a halfling like himself, and offers to hang out with him in his airship. Jarlaxle politely declines but Gormon wouldn’t take no for an answer, so he immediately has Herald grab him and fly him up to his ship, and he flies up along with Herald with his dragon wings. After taking him up to the ship, he quickly got bored and dropped Jarlaxle from all the way up in his airship down to the ground. But luckily, with his monk training, he manages to stick the landing and took minimal damage.
        After that, they took the rest of their night’s drinking to the Tacksfrod Tavern, a location that quickly garnered a lot more fame due to it being owned by the heros who ended Halaster’s reign of power. After hanging there for a bit, they get a message from a Drow named Helios, telling them that the gnome across the street (I forgot his real name, I’ll be calling him PG for purple gnome and it’s just funny how little the name PG fits him :skull:) saying that he has information that may be important for them. So, in the morning on the next day, the party visited Ol’ PG’s shop. He told them that he had information for them, but only if “Jarlaxle could... rearrange his closet for him...” and if he did then they would get the info. Ori questioned him on this for a while until Gabe got impatient and decided to just do it himself. I’m not gonna go in to too much detail of what happened next but... luckily not too much did. Gabe went into the closet, and PG followed him in. There was a loud slamming noise and the door burst open with Gabe holding PG by the back of his shirt, saying he “tried to do something to him”. The party got him arrested and in jail, Ori got the information they needed out of him. He said that there’s a lizardfolk who may be able to help him who owns his own shop here in Waterdeep. His name is Snapjaw, and apparently his shop is sort of hard to come by. They eventually manage to find it and when they talk to Snapjaw, he reveals that he is a double agent, acting as a spy for the rebellion against the cult, inside the walls of the cult’s main stronghold, which is in a swamp. He told them that he can bring them there and together they can take down the base.
        While Snapjaw left to get prepared for the travel, Freud and Nawala, Ori’s mother, stood in the doorway. Freud said that he has personal business that he needs to attend to, and that Nawala would be joining him, and he handed Jarlaxle a letter before quickly trying to leave through the door. Ori asked if they would ever see him again, and he told her to read the note. Now I’m not gonna post the whole note here, there will be a link to it under this, but it’s really hard to describe in text that this was a really somber moment. Deep down, the party all knew the most likely wouldn’t see him again. It was very sad, but also happy as Freud was finally standing for himself and doing what he feels like he needs to do. So, with that quick farewell, the party prepared to leave for their next location. They may have lost one great friend, but maybe they’ll gain another in Snapjaw. One thing is for sure, the next stage of their adventure has just begun.
